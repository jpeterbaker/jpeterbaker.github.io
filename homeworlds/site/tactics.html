<h2>
Choosing your homeworld
</h2>
<h3>
The small star problem
</h3>
Any time that you include a small star in your homeworld,
the economy of that star's color gets a little head start:
you've removed a small piece of that color,
so medium ships of that color may be built sooner.
Because of the danger of overpopulation,
it is a little more difficult to participate in the economies
corresponding to your home star colors.
Thus, small stars give a little boost to an economy
where you have a disadvantage
(i.e. a small star can give your opponent a shortcut).
In the extreme case, small using a small star can lead to the Instafreeze,
discussed next.
<h3>
<a name='instafreeze'/>Instafreeze
</h3>
This is a trap you can set for new players when you move second.
<br>
If your opponent chooses a small star that is blue or green,
you also choose a small star of that color <i>as well as your first ship</i>.
You can build the last small piece of that color as a ship
and freeze them out of that color (see below).

<br>
New players won't notice the problem and you can build mediums and larges
of that color before they know what hit them.
<br>
Experienced players will respond by trading their initial (large) ship
to enter the economy and the position will be about even.
<h3>
Going second
</h3>
If your opponent chose a small star,
you probably shouldn't have a small star of the same color
(unless you're attempting an Instafreeze).
<br>
They can get the last piece of that color as a ship and freeze you out.

<h2>
<a name='doomsweek'/>Slow Doomsday Machines
</h2>
Inevitable doom can take more than a day.
<ul>
    <li> Slow doomsday (doomsweek?) machine<br>
        Like a doomsday machine, but with a pair of medium yellows instead of larges.
        The first or last ship of each color can be moved singly with an ordinary yellow power move.
    <li> Extra slow (doomsmonth?) machine<br>
        No yellow sacrifice at all,
        just move the six catastrophe ships one at a time.
        Importantly, the SECOND ship of each color should be large.
        Your opponent will normally attack the first ship after you move it in.
        Then you move in a large ship, and your opponent would like to reduce the concentration of that color
        by getting rid of the first ship (which they now own).
        But they must respond to the large by attacking it
        (assuming you have sacrificial red ships somewhere to make a large ship a threat).
        The third ship (of any size) can then move in for the catastrophe.<br>
</ul>
In the image below, south has assembled a doomsmonth machine.<br>

South safely destroys both home stars of North via
<center>
<div id='moves'>move g1 S1 North</div>
<div id='moves'>move g3 S2 North</div>
<div id='moves'>move g1 S2 North<br>catastrophe North g</div>
<div id='moves'>move y1 S2 North</div>
<div id='moves'>move y3 S1 North</div>
<div id='moves'>move y1 S2 North<br>catastrophe North y</div>
</center>

Importantly, the doomsmonth machine does not work on red stars (<a href='#noSlowRedCat'>see here</a>).

<h3>
<a name='noSlowRedCat'/>No slow red catastrophe
</h3>
As long as you have a ship large enough to attack,
your opponent can't cause a red catastrophe by moving red ships one at a time.
If they attempt this,
<br>
<ol>
<li> They move a red ship into your system.
<li> You attack the first red ship.
<li> They move another red ship into your system.
<li> You sacrifice the first red ship to attack the second red ship.
<li> They see the error of their ways.
</ol>
In the position below, South has just blundered by moving r3 into North's home.
North should sacrifice the r1 and attack the invader.
South has regrets.
