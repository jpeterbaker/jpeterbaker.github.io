<h1>
Homeworlds Game Record Notation
</h1>
<p>
<a href="index.html">My main Homeworlds page</a>

<p>
I recommend a slight variation of the notation used on
<a href='https://play.abstractplay.com'>Abstract Play</a>
(aka AP or SDG 2.0).
</p>

<h2>
Actions
</h2>

<ul>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>homeworld &lt;star1&gt; &lt;star2&gt; &lt;ship&gt; &lt;systemName&gt;</span>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>build &lt;ship&gt; &lt;systemName&gt;</span>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>trade &lt;ship&gt; &lt;systemName&gt; &lt;newColor&gt;</span>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>discover &lt;ship&gt; &lt;oldSystemName&gt; &lt;newStar&gt; &lt;newSystemName&gt;</span>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>move &lt;ship&gt; &lt;oldSystemName&gt; &lt;newSystemName&gt;</span>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>attack &lt;ship&gt; &lt;systemName&gt;</span>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>sacrifice &lt;ship&gt; &lt;systemName&gt;</span>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>catastrophe &lt;systemName&gt; &lt;color&gt;</span>
    <li> <span class='cmd'>pass</span>
</ul>

<h2>
Notes
</h2>

<p>
A color is denoted by the lowercase first letter of its name in English,
such as "<span class='cmd'>y</span>" for yellow.
</p>

<p>
A piece (i.e., a ship or star) is denoted by its color's letter
and its number of pips, such as "<span class='cmd'>g2</span>" for a medium green.
</p>

<p>
Multiple turn actions are simply concatenated in the order they are performed,
with any convenient character separating the actions, for example
<br>
<span class='cmd'>
sacrifice y1 Alpha /
move b1 Beta Gamma /
catastrophe Gamma b
</span>
<br>
AP separates actions with commas, SDG used line breaks.
<br>
I like line breaks when possible, but when commands need to be on one line,
I favor semicolons ; or slashes /.
</p>

<p>
Optionally, you may write "pass" in place of an unused sacrifice action, as in
<br>
<span class='cmd'>
sacrifice r3 Alpha /
attack b1 Beta /
pass /
pass
</span>
</p>

<p>
Actions can also be abbreviated by first letter:
"<span class='cmd'>h</span>" for homeworld,
"<span class='cmd'>a</span>" for attack,
"<span class='cmd'>c</span>" for catastrophe, etc.
</p>

<p>
A new system is given a name when the system is discovered.
The name can be any string that doesn't interfere with notation.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> The name must be different from the names of other existing systems.
    <li> For clarity, the name should not resemble other recording notation.
    For example, "catastrophe" is a misleading system name.
    <li> Many players use piece notations of stars as system names,
    such as naming a system "g1" if it has a small green star.
    <br>
    If you like such system names, I recommend avoiding confusion
    by using uppercase letters for system names.
    For example, use "G1" for a system name and "g1" for small green pieces.
</ul>

<p>
When establishing a homeworld, AP does not denote a name for the system.
I recommend doing so in order to make the record complete.
</p>

<p>
When building, AP actually only lists the color (not size) of the built ship, as in
<span class='cmd'>build &lt;color&gt; &lt;system&gt;</span>.
I suggest including the size because it helps to readers who replay the game
by making bank state errors more obvious.
</p>

<p>
When trading, AP's notation subtly different from the SDG notation
<span class='cmd'>trade &lt;ship&gt; &lt;newShip&gt; &lt;system&gt;</span>.
The choice on AP to record the color (instead of the ship) avoids confusion
when systems share names with pieces.
<br>
For example, SDG's annotation
<span class='cmd'>trade r1 b1 g1</span>
(meaning "trade r1 for b1 in the system named 'g1'")
looks like it might mean
"trade r1 for g1 in the system named 'b1'."
<br>
AP's annotation
<span class='cmd'>trade r1 g1 b</span>
is more clear unless there is a system named "b."
</p>

<p>
Looney Labs is trying to phase out the term "attack"
because it suggests destruction rather than a change of ownership.
Their preferred term is, "capture."
However, I still prefer "attack" for notation
because it does not share a first letter with other actions.
"Capture" would be abbreviated "c," which may be confused with "catastrophe."
