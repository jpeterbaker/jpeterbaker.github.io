The records of all the games in tournaments I have run are on SDG.
You can find those starting from
<a href="tournament/tmain.html">my main tournament page</a>.

Let me know if you have a record of a notable game you'd like to contribute
(challenges for a medal from Andy, old world championship games, etc.).
