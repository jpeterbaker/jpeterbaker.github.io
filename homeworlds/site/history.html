History of Homeworlds

<p>
I might expand this someday into a narrative format,
especially to incorporate a description of changes to the rules.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> (1987)
    Andy Looney writes the short stories "Icehouse" and "The Children of Mars"
    describing a game played with small pyramid pieces.
    <ul>
        <li> Icehouse is described as a game played with little pyramids
        but no turns and no board.
        <li> Andy makes some prototype pieces
        but isn't able to come up with satisfactory rules for an accompanying game.
    </ul>
    <li> (1989)
    John Cooper's rules for Icehouse are published.
    Icehouse largely matches the description of the fictional game.
    <ul>
        <li> The same year, enthusiasts organize the first International Icehouse Tournament.
        <li> Cooper writes for the fan newsletter <i>Hypothermia</i> under the name Dr. Cool.
    </ul>
    <li> (1996)
    <i>Hypothermia</i> begins publishing rules for other games to play with Icehouse pieces.
    <li> (1996)
    Andy and Kristin Looney establish Looney Labs to publish Andy's card game Fluxx.
    <ul>
        <li> The success of Fluxx gives Looney Labs more freedom to develop the pyramids.
    </ul>
    <li> (1998)
    John Cooper invents IceTraders.
    <ul>
        <li> John has said that early drafts of IceTraders were called Clusterf***.
    </ul>
    <li> (1999)
    Pieces and rules for IceTraders are distributed as part of
    <i>Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set</i>.
    <li> (2000)
    <i>The Martian Chess Set</i> wins Origins award for best abstract board game.
    <li> (2001)
    John Cooper modifies the rules of IceTraders, and the result is named Homeworlds.
    <li> (2002)
    The rules of Homeworlds are published for the first time in <i>Playing with Pyramids</i>.
    <li>
    (2004)
    Looney Labs begins running two-player "Binary" Homeworlds tournaments at conventions.
    <ul>
        <li> Before 2004,
        Homeworlds was considered to be primarily a game for three or four players.
    </ul>
    <li> (2005)
    Aaron Dalton develops the website Super Duper Games (SDG)
    for playing board games by correspondence.
    <ul>
        <li> SDG includes the first online version of Homeworlds.
    </ul>
    <li> (2006-2016) Looney Labs experiments with ways to package and market Icehouse pieces.
    <li> (2015)
    Draws by simultaneous elimination informally added to the rules of Homeworlds.
    <li> (2015)
    Andy begins awarding physical medals to people who beat him at Homeworlds.
    <li> (2017)
    Babamots begin running The Great Homeworlds Tournament.
    <li> (2020)
    Homeworlds is distributed in a standalone box as a member of the Pyramid Quartet.
    <li> (2020)
    "thelast19digitsofpi" develops the website Homeworlds Live.
    <ul>
        <li> This is the first online version of Homeworlds designed for <i>real-time</i> play.
    </ul>
    <li> (2022)
    The website Board Game Arena publishes a Homeworlds implementation
    supporting both correspondence and live play.
</ul>
