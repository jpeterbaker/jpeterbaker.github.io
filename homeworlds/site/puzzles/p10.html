Capturing both of Alpha's reds seems like the obvious choice,
but that's a mistake since Alpha can then regain control of their home with a red catastrophe.
Instead, One must capture the Alpha's r2 and one of the g1 ships.
Then, Alpha must cause a red catastrophe to prevent One winning by capture:

But One still wins with a green catastrophe of their own:
