Vague instructions
</h2>
<p>
Unless otherwise stated,
the objective of each puzzle is to figure out what the current player should do.
You must always assume that your opponent will make their best move to stop you.
</p>
<p>
You should be able to determine whether you should be trying to win,
force a draw,
or just survive the current threat.
Telling you what is possible from a position robs you of a chance to size up the big picture.
</p>
<ol>
<li> If you can force a win, you should do so in as few moves as possible.
<li> If you can't force a win but can get a dominating advantage, do so.
<li> If you are close to losing and can't get a huge advantage, you should prevent defeat
(even a draw is better than a loss).
<li> If the game is not close to ending and neither player can gain a big advantage,
just find the best developmental move.
</ol>
<p>
There may be a few puzzles where it's not reasonable to analyze the position all the way to the end:
<ul>
<li>
You may find a plan that gives you an overwhelming material advantage.
In that case, you may simply assume that you will win,
even though it would be tiresome
to plan responses to every single thing your opponent might do.
I'll compare this to a chess puzzle:
if you capture your opponent's queen without trading pieces of similar value,
it's normal to assume that you will win, even though there are billions of ways that the game might proceed.
<li>
You may start out with a huge disadvantage and find a clever way to equalize your footing.
This may be considered a solution if victory is not immediately possible.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In case those objectives sound too ambiguous,
I've added hints to each puzzle that describe what the player on-move should be trying to achieve.
