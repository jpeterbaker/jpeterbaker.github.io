Vague instructions
</h2>
<p>
Unless otherwise stated,
the objective of each puzzle is to figure out what the current player should do.
You must assume that the opponent will make their best move to stop you,
so plan your responses appropriately.
</p>
<p>
You should be able to determine whether you should be trying to win,
force a draw,
or just survive the current threat.
If I told you what is possible,
I'd be robbing you of a chance to size up the big picture.
</p>
<p>
Unless the instructions say otherwise,
achieve the highest possible objective on this list.
</p>
<ol>
<li> If you can force a win, you should do so in as few moves as possible.
<li> If you can't force a win but can get a dominating advantage, do so.
You may simply assume that you will win in this case,
even though it would be tiresome
to plan responses to every single thing your opponent might do.
I'll compare this to a chess puzzle:
if you capture your opponent's queen without trading pieces of similar value,
it's normal to assume that you will win, even though there are billions of ways that the game might proceed.
<li> If you can't win, then prevent defeat.
End the game in a draw if the alternative is losing.
<li> If your opponent has a big advantage and you can't win or get an advantage or draw,
then equalize the positions so you and your opponent have about the same chances of winning.
<li> If neither player can get a big advantage in the next few moves,
just find the best developmental move.
</ol>
<p>
I know some people won't like such ambiguous objectives,
so each puzzle has a link to click that will reveal a hint about what the player on-move should be trying to do.
Even if you think you'll want this hint, I encourage you to take a good look at the position first.
It may be easier than you think!
