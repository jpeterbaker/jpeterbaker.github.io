<a href="index.html">My main Homeworlds page</a>
</p>
<p>
This page is about Homeworlds strategy at a very general level.
I also have <a href="tactics.html">a page about tactics</a>
that discusses specific scenarios and what to do in them.
</p>

<h2>
The most important questions
</h2>

<ul>
<li>"If I did nothing this turn, what would my opponent's best move be?"
<li>"If I make this move that I am considering, what will my opponent's best move be?"
</ul>

<h2>
After your opponent moves
</h2>
<p>
Identify what objective(s) they were trying to accomplish.
<ul>
<li> Was it a "victory?" Did they just get what they wanted?
<li> Or was it a "setup?" Is it just one step toward something that they want?
    <ul>
    <li> If it is a setup, can you spoil it?
    <li> Or can you get a head start on reacting to their plan's success?
    <li> Or is it safe to work on a plan of your own while they build toward their goal?
    </ul>
<li> Or was it a retreat? Were they just reacting to your last move?
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Moves can be multi-purpose.
Even after you see one purpose to your opponent's move,
check for others.
</p>
<h2>
Will your move leave a desirable piece available for your opponent to build?
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Are you building the last ship of that size?
<li>Are you discovering a system marker with the last pieces of that size?
<li>If your opponent has a medium or large green, can they sacrifice it to skip past a size in the bank?
(see the <a href='glossary.html#chameleonFactory'>Chameleon Factory</a> move).
<li>Are you abandoning a system? Will they want the marker as a ship?
<li>Are you trading a ship? Will they build the old piece?
<li>Are you sacrificing a ship? Will they build it?
<li>Are you causing a catastrophe? Will they want the pieces?
</ul>

<h2>
<a name='checklist'/>Specific things that are tiresome to constantly consider but neglect will cost you games
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Identify <u>every</u> catastrophe your opponent could possibly cause.
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow sacrifices provide extreme mobility. Check twice.
    </ul>
    <li>What if your opponent attempted an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>If they were to start moving all their ships into your home as quickly as possible, what would happen?
        <li>Could you attack the ships as quickly as they arrived?
        <li>Could there be a catastrophe that you wouldn't have time to prevent?
        <li>If their attack would just barely fail, what more do they need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
    <li>What if YOU were to attempt an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>What more do you need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name='firstMost'/>Get there first with the most
</h2>
<p>
The American Confederate general Nathan Forrest is credited with summarizing military strategy as,
"Get there first with the most."
This is a useful principle in Homeworlds.
If you already control a system, then you got there first.
If your opponent initiates a 
<a "href=glossary.html#directAssault">direct assault</a> on that system,
you will get the first opportunity to capture ships.
To successfully counteract that first-capture advantage,
your opponent will need to bring more resources to bear than you can
(a bigger ship or yellow and red sacrifices).
If you were there first and you also have "the most,"
then your system is impervious to direct assault.
</p>
<p>
So you just need to watch out for catastrophes...
</p>

<h2>
<a name='deterrent'/>A red anywhere is a red everywhere
</h2>
<p>
One of the strategic tips in any Homeworlds strategy guide is,
"When your opponent gets red, get red yourself."
This is good advice.
It often doesn't even matter much where the red ships are.
If your opponent has a red ship anywhere,
you need to get one anywhere that you can.
Otherwise, your opponent can move any ship to a system where you have ships
and you won't be able to capture it (unless the star is red).
Your opponent will then be able to capture your ship(s) by sacrificing their red ship.
</p>
<p>
A single red ship can simultaneously deter invasions at all of your systems.
Regardless of which system your opponent chooses to invade,
you can sacrifice the red ship and capture the invading ship.
Consequently, your opponent may choose not to attempt any invasions.
I call this the "deterrent principle."
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if your opponent lacks red, your red ship can be used to power an invasion
of <u>any</u> of their systems.
</p>

<h4>
...but a red ship can only be sacrificed once
</h4>
<p>
A single red ship can deter attacks for quite a while,
but remember that a single red ship can only be sacrificed once.
If your opponent launches an invasion that forces you to sacrifice your only red ship,
then you don't have a red ship anymore.
You may now be vulnerable to a second invasion
where your opponent has red ships to sacrifice but you do not.
If that invasion is at your homeworld, you're likely to lose the game.
</p>

<h2>
<a name='alwaysCat'/>Always call catastrophe
</h2>
<p>
This whole section deals with the very rare case that an overpopulation
is created by a player who doesn't want to trigger a catastrophe.
Overpopulations are almost always created intentionally
so that triggering the catastrophe will destroy their opponent's resources.
I even find myself using the words "overpopulation" and "catastrophe" almost interchangeably.
But the topic of unwanted overpopulations comes up in strategy conversations,
so it's my intention to thoroughly explore the topic here.
I'm not going to try to concoct a game position where it might happen reasonably.
There was an overpopulation in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAIn7kDugGE&t=822s">this Homeworlds Theater episode</a>
on which neither player wanted to call catastrophe,
but overpopulating in the first place was a very poor move.
</p>
<p>
With some rare exceptions to this already rare situation,
if your turn is going to end with an overpopulation on the board for any reason,
you should always trigger the catastrophe, even if it's a bad catastrophe for you.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> If it's a catastrophe that's good for you, then obviously you should trigger it.
    This is usually what happens in games.
    <li> If it's a catastrophe that's bad for you, then your opponent will just trigger it on their turn.
    What's more, if you let them trigger it, they might find a way to get some advantage out of
    triggering the catastrophe <u>after</u> they perform some other action
    (like building a large ship that will be unavailable after the catastrophe).
    So it is no worse and possibly better for you to trigger it yourself.
</ul>
<p>
There can also be catastrophes that won't change the result of a game.
and of course in that case, it won't matter whether you trigger it,
I still recommend calling catastrophe if you think it's a break-even catastrophe
just in case you've miscalculated.
</p>
<p>
Human calculations on Homeworlds positions aren't perfect,
so you may not be sure whether a catastrophe is good, bad, or neutral.
But as I've just argued, you should trigger all kinds of catastrophes,
so it doesn't even matter if you don't know which kind it is.
Trigger it anyway.
</p>

<h4>
...unless you really want to trust in psychology
</h4>
<p>
So theoretically speaking, you should <u>never</u> leave an overpopulation on the board after your turn.
Strict game theoretical logic dictates that every overpopulation should become a catastrophe,
But there are several justifications for not triggering catastrophes
that are based on a belief in an opponent's imperfect mental state
(nobody thinks as perfectly as the game theory argument requires).
You may choose not to trigger a catastrophe as a gamble
that your opponent will also choose not to trigger it for some reason.
In that case, they will have gifted you another turn to try to resolve the overpopulation advantageously.
</p>

<center>
<h5>
Opponent has different beliefs
</h5>
</center>
<p>
There's an argument for not triggering a catastrophe
when you and your opponent have different beliefs about whether the catastrophe is bad.
Models of what people think about what others are thinking
can (literally) get infinitely complicated,
as in, "Does he know that I know that he knows that I know that he ate my cookie?"
It's difficult to give strategy advice about something so complex,
but I'm going to give it a shot.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that you believe that a catastrophe is bad for you,
but your opponent believes that the catastrophe is bad for them instead
(and you know that they they think it is bad for them).
My argument in the previous section is that
you should trigger the bad catastrophe because your opponent will do it anyway
and they might gain some advantage by performing another action first.
But that was based on players calculating perfectly
and therefore agreeing on who benefits from the catastrophe.
If you <u>don't</u> trigger the catastrophe,
your opponent will try to defuse the overpopulation
because they believe that the catastrophe is bad for them.
<p>
If your opponent can't remove the overpopulation,
then they are in the position that you were just in;
they are wondering whether to trigger a bad catastrophe.
If they know that you think the catastrophe is bad for you
(which they may suspect from the fact that you just declined to trigger it),
then they may decline to trigger the catastrophe using your same reasoning.
This could carry on until a player finds a way to
trade, move, or sacrifice one of the ships involved in the overpopulation.
</p>
<p>
Notice that a catastrophe can't <u>actually</u> be bad for both you and for your opponent
since this is a zero-sum game.
But usually, neither of you can analyze the position perfectly.
You both make mistakes.
If you know your opponent well enough,
you may know what kinds of miscalculation they tend to make
and how that will affect their evaluation of a catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose that (in your opinion),
your opponent overestimates the strength of large ships.
Say there is an overpopulation involving three of your medium ships
and one of your opponent's large ships.
You might think your three mediums are worth more than their large
but also know that your opponent thinks that their large is better than your three mediums.
You are happy to not trigger the catastrophe,
and (assuming that you are correct about how they think)
your opponent won't trigger it either
(which you believe is good for you).
<p>
Besides miscalculation, other things can cause players to have different beliefs.
For example, if you're playing with time control,
each player may think that they are more likely than their opponent to make mistakes under time pressure.
Prolonging the game will put both players under time pressure,
so each player thinks that they will be at a disadvantage in a long game.
If there's a catastrophe that is expected to prolong the game,
then you may each think that triggering the catastrophe is bad for you.
If you know that your opponent thinks that <u>you</u> are more vulnerable to time pressure than they are
(the opposite of your belief),
then it is reasonable to not trigger the catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, energy for concentration is a limited resource that needs to be managed,
even in a game that isn't under formal time control.
If you believe that you are more tired than your opponent
but you believe that your opponent thinks that you are more tired than they are,
then you can reasonably not trigger a game-prolonging catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
The examples above take as a premise that
a catastrophe that destroys similar amounts of material for both players
tends to make the game last longer.
It's been my experience that catastrophes
(at least ones in <a href="glossary.html#colony">colonies</a>) are often followed
by several turns of rebuilding for both players,
which slows the game down.
This principle definitely doesn't apply to catastrophes that involve a homestar,
which tend to <a href="#swiftVictory">accelerate the game dramatically</a>.
Maybe you believe that the catastrophe in your game will make the game end sooner
than if the catastrophe didn't happen.
In that case, just reverse the beliefs from the earlier arguments.
If each player believes themself to be less vulnerable to time pressure than their opponent,
then they may reasonably choose not to trigger a game-shortening catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
To summarize this subsection,
it is reasonable for you to not trigger a catastrophe if
</p>
<ul>
    <li> You think that the catastrophe is bad for you.
    <li> You believe that your opponent erroneously thinks that the catastrophe is bad for them.
    If your opponent also declines to trigger the catastrophe,
    it will be because they really do believe that the catastrophe is bad for them.
</ul>
<p>
What makes a catastrophe "bad" depends on
each player's beliefs about their opponent's position evaluation heuristics
and on each player's beliefs about less-tangible factors such as
their opponent's ability to calculate under time pressure.
</p>

<center>
<h5>
Opponent has feelings
</h5>
</center>
<p>
It <u>feels</u> bad to lose important ships to a catastrophe
(unless it brings you closer to victory).
So if a catastrophe destroys ships for both players,
neither of you may <u>want</u> to trigger it
because of the bad feeling of losing ships.
So consider the case where there's an overpopulation
that would destroy lots of material for both you and your opponent.
Even if you think that the catastrophe is slightly better for your opponent's position,
you might reasonably not trigger it.
You should do this not for strictly logical reasons,
but in the hope that your opponent won't <u>feel</u> like losing that much material
for only a small advantage.
</p>

<center>
<h5>
Opponent's inexperience
</h5>
</center>
<p>
Finally, you might want to neglect triggering a catastrophe against a very inexperienced opponent.
New players might not notice the overpopulation;
they might not even know what a catastrophe is.
So you might be able to get away with an un-triggered catastrophe due to ignorance,
but, I absolutely do not condone exploiting players who don't know all of the rules.
You should make it a teaching moment by pointing out what they ought to do.
(And by the way, how did such an inexperienced player manage to tangle you into an unwanted overpopulation anyway?)
</p>

<center>
<h5>
Opponent's clock can run instead of yours
</h5>
</center>
<p>
I can think of one reason to not trigger a catastrophe
that doesn't have to do with your opponent's head.
It has to do with time control instead.
</p>
<p>
Suppose that
</p>
<ul>
<li> You are playing with time control.
<li> There is an overpopulation on the board that is bad for you.
<li> You are sure that, if you leave the overpopulation on the board,
your opponent will <u>not</u> be able to get some extra advantage by triggering the catastrophe
at the end of their turn instead of the beginning.
</ul>
<p>
You might want to leave the overpopulation on the board
so that your opponent has to trigger the catastrophe themself,
which will cost them some time.
If you are playing with physical pieces,
carrying out the physical act of clearing the catastrophe pieces from the board
and sorting them back in the bank can easily take 10 seconds or more.
If you're playing on a digital system,
it will probably still take them some time
to tell the computer that they want to trigger the catastrophe.
All else being equal, it's better if that time comes off of your opponent's clock rather than yours.
(Just don't spend so long thinking about it that you wipe out the time savings).
</p>

<h4>
...unless there are three or more players
</h4>
<p>
This whole section on when to trigger catastrophes goes out the window
if you're not playing Binary Homeworlds.
When three or more players are involved, you can engage in diplomacy,
which is a type of strategy, but if I ever discuss diplomacy, it will be on a separate page.
</p>
<p>
For an easy example of when not to trigger a catastrophe in a three-player game,
suppose that Alice is winning against Bob and Carol.
Bob and Carol have agreed to cooperate with each other for a while
until Alice is less of a threat.
Suppose Bob moves a large ship into one of Carol's systems in order to help defend against Alice,
but Bob's ship is the same color as three of Carol's ships.
Carol doesn't trigger the catastrophe that would harm herself and her ally.
Instead, Carol can move, trade, or sacrifice a ship to remove the overpopulation.
Of course, Alice would trigger that catastrophe if it were still on the board when her turn came.
</p>

<h2>
<a name='materialAdvantage'/>Material advantage
</h2>
<p>
If you have a material advantage, you should be willing to cause catastrophes or
force mutual sacrifices that trim down both fleets by similar amounts.
A one-ship advantage is a bigger deal when both fleets are small than
when they are large.
</p>
<p>
Contrariwise, when you have a material disadvantage, you should build ships and
not worry too much if your opponent builds the same amount.
A one-ship disadvantage shrinks (proportionately) if both fleets grow at
the same rate.
</p>
<p>
If you have more large ships than your opponent, try to harass their systems
before they have time to get another large ship.
Move that big ship into an enemy system with lots of smaller ships and no big ship defending.
Attack any ships that don't manage to escape.
Be careful of catastrophes, which are often the best defense against larger ships.
</p>
<p>
If you have a large-ship disadvantage, spread your fleet out.
A lone ship that can run away is an unattractive target for an invading large.
Ideally, every ship should be be either
<ul>
<li> In a system with a large defender
<li> Or in a system with no other ships, but with an escape plan
(the ship or star is yellow).
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
<a name='redFlags'/>Red flags
</h2>

<p>
Here are BAD situations, roughly in order from worst to least-worst.
I need to avoid these things (unless I can make something even worse happen to my opponent).
Contrariwise, it's good if my opponent has one of these problems.
<ol>
<li>I have no ships in my home and I lose the game.
<li>My opponent has more (or bigger) ships in my home system than I can capture in one turn,
even by sacrificing my largest red.
<li>One of my home system markers is destroyed.
<li>I don't have a large ship in my home system.
<li>There is a near-catastrophe (three pieces) involving my ships
(or the marker for a system where I have ships).
<li>My opponent has a red ship (<a href="#deterrent">anywhere</a>) and I do not.
<li>My opponent has more large ships than me.
<li>My opponent has more yellow ships than me.
<li>My opponent has a ship in the same system as me and it's bigger than my ships there.
<li>The ship(s) in my home system are all the same color
(the <a href='glossary.html#bluebird'/>Bluebird</a> mistake).
<li>My only large ship in my home system is the same color as one (or more!) ships or markers in my home
(my opponent might get a <a href='glossary.html#demolitionFleet'>Demolition Fleet</a>).
</ol>
</p>

<h2>
<a name='swiftVictory'/>Plan for complete, swift victory
</h2>
<p>
As the Homeworlds rules say,
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.looneylabs.com/sites/default/files/literature/Homeworlds%20Rules13.pdf">
"One of the easiest ways to lose this game is<br>
to mount an attack that fails to annihilate your<br>
opponent, but leaves your own empire vulnerable.<br>
This most often happens when you knock out half<br>
of a player's Homeworld, leaving you with fewer<br>
ships and your opponent with a better-connected<br>
Homeworld than before. Plan for total victory!"
</blockquote>
<p>
This is good advice, and I'd like to add some details.
The act of destroying one of your opponent's homestars has three destabilizing effects on the game,
each of which can open new opportunities for your opponent to suddenly ruin your plan.
</p>
<h4>
1. You lost ships
</h4>
<p>
Destroying one of your opponent's stars usually costs you at least three ships.
A two turn demolition can be achieved with three small star-colored ships and a y2--if
you're lucky enough to have all three small ships of the star's color.
Otherwise, you'll be destroying two or more of your own mediums and/or at least one large
(more on what ship size combinations can be used to destroy stars <a href="tactics.html#doomsweek">here</a>).
In many games, that much ship destruction is enough to turn the balance of material power in your opponent's favor.
</p>

<h4>
2. Your opponent's homeworld gained connections
</h4>
<p>
After a star's destruction, your opponent's home is connected to systems with stars of the destroyed star's size
(the <a href="glossary.html#hyperspaceBypass">hyperspace bypass</a> principle).
If that star was a size that is in your own home,
your homes are now connected (assuming that the universe was originally large).
Having connected homes may give your opponent a chance at a counter-attack.
</p>

<h4>
3. The bank is refreshed
</h4>
<p>
The bank now has the pieces involved in your catastrophe,
the stars of any systems that you abandoned,
and your sacrificed ship (if you used one).
Your opponent may be able to trade or build the pieces that you just returned.
If you were barely containing your opponent's advances before,
then the new ships might be just what they needed to get back in the game.
This is especially true if a y3 piece was placed in the bank as a result of your star demolition.
A new y3 ship might give your opponent the mobility they need to give you trouble.
</p>

<h4>
...so minimize the come-back risk
</h4>
<p>
Destroying a homestar can throw a game into chaos in the ways listed above,
and you should minimize the length of the chaotic period by
destroying the second star as quickly as possible.
If the second-star demolition plan requires you to build more ships
or to move ships to different systems,
try to perform this preparation <u>before</u> destroying the first star.
</p>

<h2>
Last thoughts
</h2>

<p>
Homeworlds is a game where it's easy to charge ahead with your own plans
while ignoring what your opponent is up to until it's too late.
That's why most of these tips focus on making sure you
look at what your opponent is working on.
Choosing a goal and taking little steps toward it is often easy.
Figuring out your opponent's plan takes work.
