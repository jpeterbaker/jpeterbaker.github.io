<a href="index.html">My main Homeworlds page</a>
</p>
For now, I'm leaving out the most basic terms (e.g. "ship" and "build").
<h2>
Official terms
</h2>
<ul>
<li> Homeworld marker combinations
<ul>
    <li> <u>Banker</u><br>
        A small and a medium marker
        (good for setting up investments).
    <li> <u>Fortress</u><br>
        A medium and a large marker
        (difficult to invade after most of the small pieces become ships).
    <li> <u>Goldilocks</u><br>
        A small and a large marker
        (comfortably between the banker and fortress).
    <li> <u>Gemini star</u><br>
        Two markers of the same size.
</ul>

<li> Universe sizes<br>
The sizes of the pieces in the players' homeworlds
affect how many move actions it takes for a ship to travel from one to the other.
This affects the length and style of the game.
<ul>
    <li> <u>Large universe</u><br>
        Players' homeworlds are three moves apart from each other.
        Large universes are considered standard.
    <li> <u>Small universe</u><br>
        Players' homeworlds are two moves apart.
    <li> <u>Microverse</u><br>
        Players' homeworlds are one move apart (they are connected).
</ul>

<li> The three paths to victory
<ul>
    <li> <a href="#directAssault">Direct assault</a> on your opponent's Homeworld.
    <li> A <a href="#fleetCatastrophe">fleet catastrophe</a> destroying all enemy ships in their homeworld.
    <li> <a href="#starDemolition">Star demolition</a> against each of your opponent's two home stars.
</ul>

<li> <u>Abandonment</u><br>
    Removing the last ship from a system so that it <a href="#fade">fades</a>
    (its marker(s) return to the bank).

<li> <u>Achilles color</u><br>
    The color of the only system marker of your homeworld (after one star has been destroyed).
    Since your opponent can will by causing one catastrophe of that color at your home,
    that color is your "weak spot."

<li> <u>Binary</u><br>
    "Binary" has two meanings in Homeworlds.
    <ul>
        <li> Homeworlds was originally conceived as a four-player game.
        The term "Binary Homeworlds" was introduced to distinguish the two-player variant game.
        <br>
        Homeworlds is now most popular as a two-player game,
        and the word "Binary" is usually omitted unless there could be confusion with other game types.
        The Pyramid Quartet rules booklet refers to versions of the game
        with more than two players as "non-Binary."
        <li> "Binary stars" are the two star markers in players' home systems at the start of the game.
    </ul>

<li> <a name="bluebird"/><u>Blurbird mistakes</u><br>
    Allowing your entire home fleet to be destroyed in a single catastrophe.
    <ul>
    <li> <u>Sitting duck</u><br>
    You have nothing but three ships of the same color in your home.
    Your opponent destroys you by moving in the fourth.
    <li> <u>Easy Bluebird</u><br>
    You have nothing but two ships of the same color in your home.
    Your opponent destroys you by sacrificing a y2 to move in two more ships of that color
    (each from 1 move away).
    <li> <u>Tricky Bluebird</u><br>
    You have nothing but two ships of the same color in your home.
    Your opponent destroys you by sacrificing a y3 to move in two more ships of that color
    (one from 1 move away and another from 2 moves away).
    </ul>

<li> <a name="cadet"/><u>Cadet</u><br>
    Someone who knows the rules of several Looney Pyramid games,
    but not enough to qualify as a <a href="#starshipCaptain">starship captain</a>.
    In a Homeworlds game, <a href="#jrSrOfficers">junior officers</a> are sometimes referred to as cadets.

<li> <a name="catastrophe"/><u>Catastrophe</u><br>
    Removing all of the pieces in a system that are part of an overpopulation.
    Performing this optional action may be called
    "triggering" or "declaring" the catastrophe.

<li> <a name="contest"/><u>Contest</u><br>
    Attempt to take <a href="#control">control</a> of a system.
    A system where both players have ships is "contested."
    If only one player has ships in a system, then the system is "uncontested."

<li> <a name="control"/><u>Control</u><br>
    You control a ship if it belongs to you.
    <br>
    Control of a system is a fuzzy concept.
    Of course, if a system is <a href="#contest">uncontested</a>,
    then the player with ships in the system controls it.
    You also control a system if you could comfortably remove
    the enemy ship(s) that are there (by capture or catastrophe).
    Your ability to remove enemy ships can be heavily dependent
    on whether you or your opponent gets to attack first.
    <br>
    Sometimes it is not clear which player controls a system.
    There are also times when both players have ships in a system
    but neither player controls it
    (for example, when the players are unwilling
    to sacrifice any of their red ships to gain control of the system).

<li> <a name="demolitionFleet"/><u>Demolition fleet</u><br>
    A tactic to destroy your opponent's only large ship in their home
    and simultaneously invade with a large ship of your own.<br>
    Your opponent has only one large ship at home along
    with another piece of that color.
    Sacrifice a y3 to move two ships of that color to their home,
    call catastrophe, and move in a large ship.
    You are likely to win if you have a red somewhere for sacrifice.

<li> <a name="directAssault"/><u>Direct assault</u><br>
    Taking <a href="#control">control</a> of a system (especially a homeworld) by using red power to attack the enemy ships.

<li> <u>Discovery</u><br>
    Moving a ship to a new system with a marker taken from the bank.

<li> <u>Doomsday machine</u><br>
    A collection of nine ships arranged such that they can destroy
    the opponent's homeworld in two turns.
    The ships you need are
    <ul>
    <li> Two large yellow ships (anywhere).
    <li> Three ships of the color of one of your opponent's home stars.
    These ships must be in systems one move away from your opponent's home.
    <li> Three ships of the color of  your opponent's <u>other</u> home star.
    These ships must be in systems that
    <u>will be</u> one move away from your opponent's home
    <u>after</u> your opponent's other home star is destroyed
    (see the <a href="#hyperspaceBypass">Hyperspace Bypass</a>).
    <li>Any additional ship to keep your homeworld occupied.
    </ul>
    You employ the Doomsday machine over two turns
    by sacrificing the large yellows
    to move each of the groups of three ships into your opponent's home
    and declaring the catastrophe.

<li> <u>Factory</u><br>
    A large green ship and at least one other green ship
    when there are no greens left in the bank.
    The g3  may be sacrificed and rebuilt
    effectively allowing two build actions per turn.

<li> <a name="fleetCatastrophe"/><u>Fleet catastrophe</u><br>
    A catastrophe that destroys all of a player's ships in their own homeworld
    (see <a href="#bluebird">the Bluebird mistakes</a>).

<li> <u>Frozen out</u><br>
    The inability to (safely) get even a single ship of some color.
    If one player is frozen out of some color,
    their opponent has a "monopoly" on that color.

<li> <u>Galactic overlord</u><br>
    This was never an official game term,
    but in 2020, Andy Looney asked the Homeworlds Facebook group
    what they thought about referring to all Homeworlds players as "galactic overlords"
    (as a replacement for "<a href="#starshipCaptain">starship captain</a>").
    He decided not to include the term in the official rules.

<li> <u>Green teleport</u><br>
    Sacrificing a green to rebuild it in another system.

<li> <a name="happySystem"/><u>Happy system</u><br>
    An <a href="#contest">uncontested</a> system with exactly one piece of each color (including system markers).

<li> <u>Homeworld</u><br>
    A player-owned system for which the game is named.
    A player's homeworld may be called their home, home system, or homeworld system.
    Just as as the terms "<a href="#system">system</a>" and "<a href="#star">star</a>"
    are informally interchanged,
    "homeworld" may refer to the star(s) marking a home system.
<br>
    A player creates their homeworld on their first turn
    and must defend it or lose.
    Initially, homeworld systems are marked with <a href="#binary">binary stars</a>,
    so it's clear which systems are homes.
    If one of the stars is destroyed in a homeworld,
    players may like to use an improvised token as a reminder that the system is still a home.

<li> <a name="hyperspaceBypass"/><u>Hyperspace bypass</u><br>
    The change in system connectivity that occurs
    when one marker is destroyed in a home system.

<li> <u>Investment</u><br>
    Occupying a larger-marker system with a green ship
    with the intention of sacrificing the green piece
    and immediately building the large marker as a ship.
    An investment makes the large star piece unavailable for the opponent to build,
    so it's like making a reservation.

<li> <a name="jrSrOfficers"/><u>Junior and senior officers</u><br>
    Relatively inexperienced and experienced Homeworlds players, respectively.

<li> <u>Keep-away</u><br>
    Discovering a star rather than letting your opponent build the marker piece as a ship.

<li> <u>Overpopulation</u><br>
    The presence of four (or more) pieces of the same color in a system
    (including ships and system markers).
    If an overpopulation is present anywhere in the game,
    any player may declare that the overpopulation
    has become a catastrophe.

<li> <u>Planetary defense system</u><br>
    A red star in a home system.

<li> <u>Primary directive</u><br>
    Defend the homeworld with these principles:
    <ul>
        <li> Keep a large ship in your homeworld.
        <li> Get a red when your opponent does.
        <li> Diversify and minimize your home fleet.
        <li> Once one star is destroyed, monopolize the other color.
    </ul>

<li> <u>Quick start</u><br>
    A homeworld configuration including a yellow star.

<li> <u>Red alert</u><br>
    A warning that a player might give to their opponent
    who is one move away from elimination
    (equivalent to "check" in chess).

<li> <a name="star"/><u>Star</u><br>
    A standing pyramid that shows the existence of a <a href="#system">system</a>.
    Stars are also called "planets" by some people sometimes.

<li> <a name="starDemolition"/><u>Star demolition</u><br>
    Destroying a star with a catastrphe.

<li> <u>Star-towing</u><br>
    Moving the physical play pieces (especially system markers) to clarify their relationships.
    Players often arrange the star map with the convention that
    systems controlled by a played placed on the same side of the play area.
    If a system is conquered by the other player,
    its marker and ships may be "towed" to the other side.

<li> <a name="starshipCaptain"/><u>Starship captain</u><br>
    Someone who knows the rules of at least ten Looney Pyramid games.
    Historically, all Homeworlds players were called starship captains
    (see also <a href="#galacticOverlord">galactic overlord</a>).

<li> <u>Squonking</u><br>
    Sacrificing a ship to prevent its capture.<br>
    Andy also uses the term for trading a ship to block larger builds,
    as in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGbIxb9lFds&t=1450s">this Homeworlds Theater</a>.

<li> <a name="system"/><u>System</u> (or star system)<br>
    A "space" marked with a <a href="#star">star</a> which may be occupied by ships.
    The word "system" sometimes refers directly to the star itself.

<li> <u>Terraforming</u><br>
    Sacrificing a yellow ship and discovering the piece as a star in the same move.
</ul>

<h2>
Terms I use
</h2>
<ul>
<li>If I control a system in a large-universe game, then that system may be my
    <ul>
    <li> <u>Colony</u><br>
        if it is connected to my home and not my opponent's.
    <li> <u>Outpost</u><br>
        if it is connected to my opponent's home and not my own.
    <li> <u>Island</u><br>
        if it is connected to neither home.
    </ul>

<li> <u>Andy's home</u><br>
    The homeworld with b2 and r1 stars and a g3 ship (<a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Andy/Games/ILoveHomeworlds.html#Opening">Andy's standard start</a>).

<li> <u>Big no-no</u><br>
    Failing to keep a large ship in your homeworld.

<li> <a name="concentration"/><u>Concentration</u><br>
    The number of pieces of the same color in a system (including enemy ships and system markers).
    A <a href="#happySystem">happy system</a> is one where you own all of the ships
    and every color has concentration of one.
    If concentration of a color is zero, then you don't have access to that technology.
    The higher the concentration, the more the risk of your opponent causing a catastrophe.

<li> <a name="deterrent"/><u>Deterrent principle</u><br>
     A red anywhere is a red everywhere, <a href="strategyGuide.html#deterrent">explained here</a>.

<li> <a name="dirtyFactory"/><u>Dirty factory</u><br>
    Sacrificing a g3 to quickly build the three ships of another color
    including at least one large.
    This can be used to quickly lock your opponent out of that color,
    or to get an additional large ship
    without giving your opponent the chance to get a large ship.

<li> <u>Doomsweek machine</u><br>
    Like a Doomsday machine but slow-acting, <a href="tactics.html#doomsweek">explained here</a>.

<li> <a name="fade"/><u>Fade</u><br>
    Removing a system from the game and puttting its marker in the bank.
    This is the consequence of the system being abandoned.


<li> <u>Gilligan</u> (until I think of a better name)<br>
    A ship that is "stuck" in a system because there is no yellow or blue there.
    If there were yellow, the ship could leave.
    If there were blue, the ship could turn yellow and leave.
    I see this most often when a red ship moves to a green system.
    <br>
    Unless it is worthwhile to stage a rescue by bringing yellow or blue (by move or sacrifice),
    a Gilligan may be doomed to be unimportant to the game.
    <br>
    Making a Gilligan may be necessary when reducing a color <a href="#concentration">concentration</a>
    or for occupying a system marker that is best kept out of enemy hands.
    Once it is stranded, a Gilligan can be still helpful if it is rescued or sacrificed.
    Also the threat of sacrificing a red Gilligan can be a useful
    <a href="strategyGuide.html#deterrent">deterrent</a>.

<li> <u>Instafreeze</u><br>
   The fastest possible economic freeze, <a href="tactics.html#instafreeze">explained here</a>.

<li> <u>Local economy</u><br>
    The collection of colors at a particular system.
    For example, if you move/trade away your last red ship in a system, you have lost the local red economy.

<li> <u>Material</u><br>
    The amount of ship power a player has.
    A player has a material advantage if they have more ships or larger ships.
    Very roughly, material can be measured
    as the total pip count of a player's ships.
    I myself usually use this modified material score:
        <ul>
        <li> each small ship = 1
        <li> each medium ship = 3
        <li> first large ship = 12
        <li> second large ship = 9
        <li> each additional large ship = 7
        </ul>

<li> <u>Milking the cow</u><br>
    Repeatedly building and trading a large ship of a color that you have monopolized.

<li> <u>Soft freeze</u><br>
    When a player has one ship of a color, but they can't safely build another ship of that color.
    This happens often when a player's only ship of some color is the large at their home system
    and they also have a home star of that color.
    Building a ship of that color would mean three pieces of the same color could be in their home,
    which is usually a nonstarter if their opponent could cause a catastrophe.
    The player also doesn't want to move their only large ship out of their home for fear of invasion.

<li> <u>Spock</u> (until I think of a better name)<br>
    A red ship that is sacrificed in order to capture a red ship in the same system
    when the opponent is attempting a red catastrophe.
    The attack could have been performed without the sacrifice,
    but the sacrifice reduces the red concentration and saves the other ships.
    See
    <a href="tactics.html#noSlowRedCat">this section</a>
    on preventing slow red catastrophes.
</ul>
