I also ran
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>
on the tournament results,
which is a method of assigning points to players according to which players they defeated.
Defeating a strong player gives more points.
The number of points that each player gets is a multiple of the sum of the points of their opponents.
(I added 0.01 wins to every pair so that the directed win-graph was strongly connected.)

<h3>
Bits of advice
</h3>
<ul>
<li> Please remember to confirm with your opponent that the game is for the tournament before you begin.
<li> Try to challenge people who still have lots of games to play. This will help them catch up.
<li> If you are playing as many games as you can handle, you may want to cancel any remaining challenges that you issued. Otherwise, someone could accept and give you one game too many. 
</ul>
