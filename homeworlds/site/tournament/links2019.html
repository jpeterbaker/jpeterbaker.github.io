Tournament Participation Instructions
</h2>

<h3>
Bits of advice
</h3>
<ul>
<li> Please remember to confirm with your opponent that the game is for the tournament before you begin.
<li> Try to challenge people who still have lots of games to play. This will help them catch up.
<li> If you are playing as many games as you can handle, you may want to cancel any remaining challenges that you issued. Otherwise, someone could accept and give you one game too many. 
</ul>
