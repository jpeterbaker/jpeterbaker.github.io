<h2>
What Anywhere Board Games is
</h2>
<p>
<a href='http://anywhereboardgames.com/'>Anywhere Board Games</a> (ABG)
is an open source web app for playing board games online in real time.
The interface is drag-and-drop based with a context menu for special operations,
like rotating a piece or changing (flipping) its state (face).
</p>
<p>
Users can provide .abg files (JSON format) to the server
in order to describe pieces, their positions, and image URLs
of what they pieces should look like in each state.
Pieces can be added to a game in progress,
and the game state can be saved as a .abg file for future use,
so the game board is also a game creation tool.
</p>
<p>
<span style="background-color:yellow">Users need to run their own servers</span>
(unlike SDG, ABG does not run servers for you to play on).
The Windows version of ABG comes with a launcher for an Apache server
(this is the only version I've tested so far).
Clients can then connect with browsers via IP address
(the default port for the Windows version is 8080).
</p>
<h2>
Playing Homeworlds through ABG
</h2>
<p>
You can download my .abg files for Homeworlds using the links below.
I plan to make several similar versions to include different features
(support for more players, colorblind-friendly pieces, etc.).
I will list them here as they are created.
</p>
<p>
You should right click on the link and choose "Save link/target as..."
You can open the file once you are connected to an ABG server through the game interface.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href='../abg/setups/binary-homeworlds-token.abg'>ABG file</a>: Binary Homeworlds with turn token, full-scale pieces
<li> <a href='../abg/setups/binary-homeworlds-token.abg'>ABG file</a>: Binary Homeworlds with turn token, half-scale pieces
<li> <a href='../abg/setups/binary-homeworlds-token-5min.abg'>ABG file</a>: Binary Homeworlds with turn token and 5-minute turn timer (flip to reset), full-scale pieces
</ul>
<h2>
ABG controls
</h2>
<p>
Most piece actions are pretty easy to figure out
(click for a context menu of options like "rotate," click and drag to move).
There are modifier keys for multiple piece dragging explained

here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here are some undocumented things that I found with experimentation.
<ul>
<li> You can "flip" a piece by clicking it with the midde mouse button.
<li> You can shuffle the stack order of a collection of pieces by
surrounding them with a rectangular selection (click and drag)
and then left clicking and choosing "Shuffle."
</ul>
