<h3>
The most important questions
</h3>

<ul>
<li>"If I did nothing this turn, what would my opponent's best move be?"
<li>"If I make this move that I am considering, what will my opponent's best move be?"
</ul>

<h3>
After your opponent moves
</h3>

Identify what objective(s) they were trying to accomplish.
<ul>
<li> Was it a "victory?" Did they just get what they wanted?
<li> Or was it a "setup?" Is it just one step toward something that they want?
    <ul>
    <li> If it is a setup, can you spoil it?
    <li> Or can you get a head start on reacting to their plan's success?
    <li> Or is it safe to work on a plan of your own while they build toward their goal?
    </ul>
<li> Or was it a retreat? Were they just reacting to your last move?
</ul>

Moves can be multi-purpose.
Even after you see one purpose to your opponent's move,
check for others.

<h3>
Will your move leave a desirable piece available for your opponent to build?
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are you building the last ship of that size?
<li>Are you discovering a system marker with the last pieces of that size?
<li>Are you abandoning a system? Will they want the marker as a ship?
<li>Are you trading a ship? Will they build the old piece?
<li>Are you sacrificing a ship? Will they build it?
<li>Are you causing a catastrophe? Will they want the pieces?
<li>If your opponent has a medium or large green, can they sacrifice it to skip past a size in the bank and get a larger size than you could?
</ul>

<h3>
Specific things that are tiresome to constantly consider but neglect will cost you games
</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Identify <u>every</u> catastrophe your opponent could possibly cause.
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow sacrifices provide extreme mobility. Check twice.
    </ul>
    <li>What if your opponent attempted an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>If they were to start moving all their ships into your home as quickly as possible, what would happen?
        <li>Could you attack the ships as quickly as they arrived?
        <li>Could there be a catastrophe that you wouldn't have time to prevent?
        <li>If their attack would just barely fail, what more do they need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
    <li>What if YOU were to attempt an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>What more do you need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name='deterrent'/>A red anywhere is a red everywhere
</h3>
Because it can be sacrificed,
a single red ship can deter potential invasions at all of your systems.
<br>
If your opponent lacks red, a single red can also be used to power an invasion
at any of their systems.
<br>
This is why one of the strategic tips in any Homeworlds material is,
"When your opponent gets red, get red yourself."

<h3>
Always Call Catastrophe
</h3>
In a two player game, if your turn is going to end with an overpopulation on the board,
you should always trigger the catastrophe, even if it's a bad catastrophe for you.
<ul>
<i> If it's a catastrophe that's good for you, then obviously you should trigger it.
<i> If it's a catastrophe that's bad for you, then your opponent will just trigger it on their turn.
What's more, if you let them trigger it, they might find a way to get some advantage out of
triggering the catastrophe <u>after</u> they perform some other action
(like building a large ship that will be unavailable after the catastrophe).
So it is no worse and possibly better for you to trigger it yourself.
</ul>
So theoretically speaking, you should never leave an overpopulation on the board after your turn.
Of course, if your opponent is so inexperienced that
they might not even notice the overpopulation,
it might be worth taking a gamble on not triggering catastrophe.
You'll have to judge that for yourself.

<h3>
Red flags
</h3>

Here are BAD situations, roughly in order from worst to least-worst.
I need to avoid these things (unless I can make something even worse happen to my opponent).
Contrariwise, it's good if my opponent has one of these problems.

<ol>
<li>I have no ships in my home and I lose the game (worst thing that can happen).
<li>My opponent has more (or bigger) ships in my home system than I can capture in one turn, even by sacrificing my largest red.
<li>One of my home system markers is destroyed.
<li>I don't have a large ship in my home system.
<li>There is a near-catastrophe (three pieces) involving my ships (or the marker for a system where I have ships).
<li>My opponent has a red ship (anywhere) and I do not.
<li>My opponent has more large ships than me.
<li>My opponent has more yellow ships than me.
<li>My opponent has a ship in the same system as me and it's bigger than my ships there.
<li>My only large ship in my home system is the same color as one (or more!) ships or markers in my home.
<li>The ship(s) in my home system are all the same color (even worse if I also have a home system marker of that color).
</ol>

<h3>
Other thoughts
</h3>

Homeworlds is a game where it's easy to charge ahead with your own plans while ignoring what your opponent is up to until it's too late. That's why these tips focus on making sure you look at what your opponent is working on. Choosing a goal and taking little steps toward it is easy. Figuring out your opponent's plans takes work.
