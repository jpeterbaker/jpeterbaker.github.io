<h2>
<a name='red_flags'/>Red flags
</h2>
<p>
As a very quick middle-game survival guide,
here are <u>bad</u> situations, roughly in order from worst to least-worst.
I call these "red flags" because they indicate a danger.
You should generally avoid these situations
unless you can make something even worse happen to your opponent.
Contrariwise, it's good if your opponent has one of these problems.
<ol>
    <li> I have no ships in my home and I lose the game.
    <li> My opponent has more (or bigger) ships in my home system than I can capture in one turn,
    even by sacrificing my largest red.
    <li> One of my home system markers is destroyed.
    <li> I don't have a large ship in my home system.
    <li> There is a near-catastrophe (three pieces) involving my ships
    (or the marker for a system where I have ships).
    <li> My opponent has a red ship (<a href="#deterrent">anywhere</a>) and I do not.
    <li> My opponent has more large ships than me.
    <li> My opponent has more yellow ships than me.
    <li> My opponent has a ship in the same system as me and it's bigger than my ships there.
    <li> The ship(s) in my home system are all the same color
    (the <a href='../glossary.html#bluebird'/>Bluebird</a> mistake).
    <li> My only large ship in my home system is the same color as one (or more!) ships or markers in my home
    (my opponent might get a <a href='../glossary.html#demolition_fleet'>Demolition Fleet</a>).
</ol>
</p>

<h2>
<a name='colony_defense'/>Colony defense
</h2>
<p>
During the middle game,
you will continue to try to get more and bigger ships than your opponent,
but now your fleet is too big to fit in your homeworld.
The other systems where you keep ships are "colonies."
Keeping your colonies safe and attacking enemy colonies is a vital skill.
Many of the same principles apply to defending and attacking homeworlds,
except that homeworlds shouldn't be evacuated in the event of an attack.
</p>
<p>
This section is mostly written for the defender.
When you are attacking, look for ways that your opponent
has failed to take this advice and exploit it!
</p>

<h3>
<a name='first_most'/>Get there first with the most
</h3>
<p>
The American Confederate general Nathan Forrest
is credited with summarizing military strategy as
"Get there first with the most."
This is a useful principle in Homeworlds.
If you already control a system, then you got there first.
If your opponent initiates a 
<a "href=glossary.html#direct_assault">direct assault</a> on that system,
you will get the first opportunity to capture ships.
To successfully counteract that first-capture advantage,
your opponent will need to bring more resources to bear than you can
(a bigger ship or yellow and red sacrifices).
If you were there first and you also have "the most,"
then your system is impervious to direct assault.
</p>
<p>
So then you just need to watch out for catastrophes...
</p>

<h3>
<a name='deterrent'/>A red anywhere is a red everywhere
</h3>
<p>
One of the strategic tips in any Homeworlds strategy guide is,
"When your opponent gets red, get red yourself."
This is good advice.
It often doesn't even matter much where the red ships are.
If your opponent has a red ship anywhere,
you need to get one anywhere that you can.
Otherwise, your opponent can move any ship to a system where you have ships
and you won't be able to capture it (unless the star is red).
Your opponent will then be able to capture your ship(s) by sacrificing their red ship.
</p>
<p>
A single red ship can simultaneously deter invasions at all of your systems.
Regardless of which system your opponent chooses to invade,
you can sacrifice the red ship and capture the invading ship.
Consequently, your opponent may choose not to attempt any invasions.
I call this the "deterrent principle."
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if your opponent lacks red, your red ship can be used to power an invasion
of <u>any</u> of their systems.
</p>

<h4>
...but a red ship can only be sacrificed once
</h4>
<p>
A single red ship can deter attacks for quite a while,
but remember that a single red ship can only be sacrificed once.
If your opponent launches an invasion that forces you to sacrifice your only red ship,
then you don't have a red ship anymore.
You may now be vulnerable to a second invasion
where your opponent has red ships to sacrifice but you do not.
If that second invasion is at your homeworld, you're likely to lose the game.
</p>

<h3>
<a name='material_advantage'/>Material advantage
</h3>
<p>
If you have a material advantage, you should often be willing to cause catastrophes or
force mutual sacrifices that trim down both fleets by similar amounts.
A one-ship advantage is a bigger deal
when both fleets are small than when they are large.
</p>
<p>
Contrariwise, when you have a material disadvantage, you should build ships and
not worry too much if your opponent builds the same amount.
A one-ship disadvantage shrinks (proportionately) if both fleets grow at
the same rate.
</p>
<p>
If you have more large ships than your opponent, try to harass colonies
before they have time to get another large ship.
Move that big ship into an enemy system
with lots of smaller ships and no big ship defending.
Attack any ships that don't manage to escape.
Be careful of catastrophes, which are often the best defense against larger ships.
</p>
<p>
If you have a large-ship disadvantage, spread your fleet out.
A lone ship that can run away is an unattractive target for an invading large.
Ideally, every ship should be be either
<ul>
<li> In a system with a large defender
<li> Or in a system with no other ships, but with an escape plan
(e.g., the ship or star is yellow).
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Alternatives to escape plans are discussed in
<a href='#invaded'>this section</a>.
</p>

<h2>
<a name='invaded'/> If your colony gets invaded
</h2>

<p>
When a colony gets invaded, you have more options than when your home is invaded.
Abandoning your homeworld is not an option (unless you can force a draw),
but it's often worthwhile to evacuate a threatened colony.
</p>
<p>
When your colony gets invaded, figure out what kind of threat the invader(s) pose.
Will they capture your ships?
Or are they preparing to overpopulate your ships,
or even the star itself?
Or maybe they just wanted to reposition their ship
and they put it in your colony to add confusion,
creating an empty threat.
</p>
<p>
If the threat is real, here are the usual options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Capture the invader
    <br>
    If the invader was just the first wave of an overpopulation attempt,
    you may have just wasted your time (and a red ship if you sacrificed).
    <li> Evacuate (run away)
    <br>
    A lone ship is usually easy to evacuate
    (moving away, green teleporting, or maybe you have a y1 worth sacrificing elsewhere)
    <br>
    Multiple ships can escape via yellow sacrifice,
    so much the better if one of those is a threatened ship.
    <br>
    Any single ship can at least avoid capture by sacrificing itself,
    even if there's nothing you want to do with the action.
    <li> Overpopulate the invader
    <br>
    If their threat is capturing your ships,
    maybe you can cost-effectively overpopulate their ship.
    <li> Overpopulate the star
    <br>
    If their ship is worth more than all of your ships in the system,
    consider blowing the whole place!
    <li> Counterattack
    <br>
    Your probably know what your opponent plans to do with their next turn
    (capture your ships or overpopulate them),
    so you may want to create a threat elsewhere that they will want to respond to first
    (e.g., poise yourself to build a big ship or invade a system of theirs).
    If you keep creating threats, they may never get to finish the invasion.
    <br>
    If the invading ship is large,
    it may have just left a colony where it was the only large defender.
    If so, consider invading that colony,
    especially if their colony has more ships you could capture
    than the colony of yours that just got invaded.
    <li> Ignore the threat
    <br>
    Sometimes you can get something more valuable elsewhere.
    For example, if you can build a couple of large ships,
    you may want to do that rather than rescuing smaller colony ships.
    <br>
</ul>
<p>
Simultaneous multi-colony invasions are like double-check.
It's difficult to deal with multiple threats.
</p>

<p>
When you go on the offensive,
just look for colonies where your opponent has
one of the weaknesses discussed in the defense section.
Then take advantage!
