<h2>
<a name='red_flags'/>Red flags
</h2>
<p>
As a very quick middle-game survival guide,
here are <u>bad</u> situations, roughly in order from worst to least-worst.
I call these "red flags" because they indicate a danger.
You should generally avoid these situations
unless you can make something even worse happen to your opponent.
Contrariwise, it's good if your opponent has one of these problems.
<ol>
    <li> I have no ships in my home and I lose the game.
    <li> My opponent has more (or bigger) ships in my home system than I can capture in one turn,
    even by sacrificing my largest red.
    <li> One of my home system markers is destroyed.
    <li> I don't have a large ship in my home system.
    <li> There is a near-catastrophe (three pieces) involving my ships
    (or the marker for a system where I have ships).
    <li> My opponent has a red ship (<a href="#deterrent">anywhere</a>) and I do not.
    <li> My opponent has more large ships than me.
    <li> My opponent has more yellow ships than me.
    <li> My opponent has a ship in the same system as me and it's bigger than my ships there.
    <li> The ship(s) in my home system are all the same color
    (the <a href='../glossary.html#bluebird'/>Bluebird</a> mistake).
    <li> My only large ship in my home system is the same color as one (or more!) ships or markers in my home
    (my opponent might get a <a href='glossary.html#demolition_fleet'>Demolition Fleet</a>).
</ol>
</p>

<h2>
<a name='colony_defense'/>Colony defense
</h2>
During the middle game,
you will continue to try to get more and bigger ships than your opponent,
but now your fleet is too big to fit in your homeworld.
The other systems where you keep ships are "colonies."
Keeping your colonies safe and attacking enemy colonies is a vital skill.
Many of the same principles apply to defending and attacking homeworlds,
except that homeworlds shouldn't be evacuated in the event of an attack.

<h3>
<a name='first_most'/>Get there first with the most
</h3>
<p>
The American Confederate general Nathan Forrest
is credited with summarizing military strategy as
"Get there first with the most."
This is a useful principle in Homeworlds.
If you already control a system, then you got there first.
If your opponent initiates a 
<a "href=glossary.html#direct_assault">direct assault</a> on that system,
you will get the first opportunity to capture ships.
To successfully counteract that first-capture advantage,
your opponent will need to bring more resources to bear than you can
(a bigger ship or yellow and red sacrifices).
If you were there first and you also have "the most,"
then your system is impervious to direct assault.
</p>
<p>
So then you just need to watch out for catastrophes...
</p>

<h3>
<a name='deterrent'/>A red anywhere is a red everywhere
</h3>
<p>
One of the strategic tips in any Homeworlds strategy guide is,
"When your opponent gets red, get red yourself."
This is good advice.
It often doesn't even matter much where the red ships are.
If your opponent has a red ship anywhere,
you need to get one anywhere that you can.
Otherwise, your opponent can move any ship to a system where you have ships
and you won't be able to capture it (unless the star is red).
Your opponent will then be able to capture your ship(s) by sacrificing their red ship.
</p>
<p>
A single red ship can simultaneously deter invasions at all of your systems.
Regardless of which system your opponent chooses to invade,
you can sacrifice the red ship and capture the invading ship.
Consequently, your opponent may choose not to attempt any invasions.
I call this the "deterrent principle."
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if your opponent lacks red, your red ship can be used to power an invasion
of <u>any</u> of their systems.
</p>

<h4>
...but a red ship can only be sacrificed once
</h4>
<p>
A single red ship can deter attacks for quite a while,
but remember that a single red ship can only be sacrificed once.
If your opponent launches an invasion that forces you to sacrifice your only red ship,
then you don't have a red ship anymore.
You may now be vulnerable to a second invasion
where your opponent has red ships to sacrifice but you do not.
If that invasion is at your homeworld, you're likely to lose the game.
</p>

<h3>
<a name='material_advantage'/>Material advantage
</h3>
<p>
If you have a material advantage, you should be willing to cause catastrophes or
force mutual sacrifices that trim down both fleets by similar amounts.
A one-ship advantage is a bigger deal when both fleets are small than
when they are large.
</p>
<p>
Contrariwise, when you have a material disadvantage, you should build ships and
not worry too much if your opponent builds the same amount.
A one-ship disadvantage shrinks (proportionately) if both fleets grow at
the same rate.
</p>
<p>
If you have more large ships than your opponent, try to harass colonies
before they have time to get another large ship.
Move that big ship into an enemy system with lots of smaller ships and no big ship defending.
Attack any ships that don't manage to escape.
Be careful of catastrophes, which are often the best defense against larger ships.
</p>
<p>
If you have a large-ship disadvantage, spread your fleet out.
A lone ship that can run away is an unattractive target for an invading large.
Ideally, every ship should be be either
<ul>
<li> In a system with a large defender
<li> Or in a system with no other ships, but with an escape plan
(the ship or star is yellow).
</ul>
