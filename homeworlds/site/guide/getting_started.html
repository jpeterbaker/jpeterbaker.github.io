Welcome to my strategy guide!
The advice below should be helpful if you just learned the rules
and wonder how to actually use your turns to make progress.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't learned the rules yet,
here are four ways to learn:
</p>
<div>
<ul>
    <li style='font-size:20px'> <a href='https://www.looneylabs.com/sites/default/files/literature/Homeworlds%20Rules13.pdf'>Read the official rules</a>.</li>
    The pages are small, but if 32 pages seems like too much,
    the rules themselves are contained in pages 1-11.
    Pages 12-32 are just advice.
    <li style='font-size:20px'> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz16s6oCIlQ'>Watch Andy's tutorial video</a>.</li>
    If you enjoy that, you should also check out
    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNrz-Vt8MU'>Andy's Deal</a>.
    <li style='font-size:20px'> <a href='https://boardgamearena.com/tutorial?game=homeworlds&tutorial=958'>Play
    the interactive tutorial on Board Game Arena</a>.</li>
    I wrote this tutorial to teach the rules of the game as quickly as possible
    with some repetition for reinforcement but minimal strategy advice.
    It takes about the same amount of time as Andy's tutorial video.
    <li style='font-size:20px'> <a href='https://homeworlds-live2.glitch.me/tutorial'>Play
    the interactive tutorial on Homeworlds Live</a>.</li>
    This multi-part tutorial covers the game rules as well as a good sample of basic strategy.
    The later modules even cover some rather advanced strategy.
    Since this tutorial is so complete,
    it also takes quite a while to finish.
</ul>

<h2>
<a name='most_important_questions'/>The most important questions
</h2>
When playing Homeworlds (or most strategy games),
you should constantly be asking yourself:
<ul>
    <li>"If I did nothing this turn, what would my opponent's best move be?"
    <li>"If I make this move that I am considering, what will my opponent's best move be?"
</ul>
If your opponent has the opportunity to do something really good for them,
that's bad for you.
Look for ways to prevent it.

<h2>
<a name='what_to_do'/>What should I be doing?
</h2>
<h3>
Your first two turns
</h3>
<p>
On your first turn, you select three pieces.
These will be the two stars of your homeworld and your first ship.
If you're nervous about making a good choice here,
here's what I recommend:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> For your first star, pick a blue piece of any size.
    <li> For your second star, pick a red piece
    that's a <u>different</u> size from your blue star.
    <ul>
        <li> If you are moving second,
        make sure your stars are <u>not</u> of the same sizes as your opponent's stars.
    </ul>
    <li> For your ship, pick a large green piece.
</ul>
<p>
On your second turn, build a small green ship.
</p>
<p>
Congratulations!
Your first two turns were about as good as what any expert would do!
</p>

<h3>
Early game basics
</h3>
<p>
For beginners, destroying the enemy homeworld seems like a distant objective.
It can be hard to know what a "good" turn looks like in the early game.
Here are some shorter-term objectives 
<ul>
    <li> Build more and bigger ships than your opponent.
    That's the main goal of the early game.
    <li> Whenever your opponent trades for a ship of a new color,
    make sure you'll be able to trade for at least one ship of that color soon.
    Otherwise, you may get <a href='glossary.html#frozen_out'>frozen out</a>.
    <ul>
        <li> And of course, try to build and trade in a way that will make
        your opponent miss out on a color.
    </ul>
    <li> When you have a few ships in a variety of colors,
    move ships to new systems so that you can continue building without overpopulating.
    <li> As you and your opponent get more red and yellow,
    you'll need to start looking at possible invasions.
    <ul>
        <li> Make sure you keep the biggest ships possible guarding your most valuable systems.
        Your homeworld is the most valuable, so it should always have a large ship.
        <li> Make sure you have red power so that,
        if your opponent decides to invade your systems,
        you can capture their ships.
        Remember that red ships can be sacrificed and used to capture anywhere you have ships,
        so having one red ship may be enough to defend all of your systems
        (at least for a while).
        <li> Avoid making nearly-overpopulated systems.
        If you have two or three valuable same-colored pieces,
        your opponent might add another ship or two for a catastrophe.
    </ul>
    <li> If your opponent leaves themselves vulnerable, attack!
    <ul>
        <li> If they have no red but you do,
        you can safely invade with a ship the same size as theirs.
        Any of their ships that don't run away can be captured.
        <li> If their ships aren't as big as yours,
        invade their colony with a ship too big for them to capture.
        <li> If they have three same-colored pieces in a system,
        move in another ship of that color to overpopulate them.
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
<a name='eye_on_opponent'/>Keep an eye on your opponent
</h2>
<p>
In Homeworlds, it's easy to charge ahead with your own plans
while ignoring what your opponent is up to until it's too late.
You must block their plans or they will overwhelm you quickly.
Before you can interfere with their plans, you must know what those plans are.
Your opponent's most recent turn is often a clue to what they are planning.
</p>
<p>
Before you start thinking about what you want to do next,
identify what objective(s) your opponent was trying to accomplish with their previous turn.
<ul>
<li> Was it a "victory?" Did they just get what they wanted?
    <ul>
        <li> Now that they have what they wanted, do you have some breathing room to advance your own plan?
        <li> Or do you need to defend against them exploiting a new advantage?
    </ul>
<li> Or was it a "setup?" Is it just one step toward something that they want?
    <ul>
    <li> If it is a setup, can you spoil it?
    <li> Or can you get a head start on reacting to their plan's success?
    <li> Or is it safe to work on a plan of your own while they build toward their goal?
    </ul>
<li> Or was it a retreat? Were they just reacting to your last threat?
    <ul>
        <li> If so, can you create another threat to keep them off balance?
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Moves can be multi-purpose.
Even after you see one purpose to your opponent's move,
check for others.
</p>

<h2>
<a name='eye_on_bank'/>Keep an eye on the bank
</h2>
<p>
Often, the most important pieces are the ones that aren't yet in play.
Every strategy guide will warn you about building the last medium or small piece.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> If you build the last small of some color,
    your opponent will probably get to build a medium.
    <li> If you build the last medium of some color,
    your opponent will probably get to build a large.
</ul>
<p>
It's usually bad if your opponent gets to build a bigger ship than you do
<u>if you won't be able to safely build that larger size as well</u>.
Some new players are <u>too</u> afraid of taking the "last serving."
Look ahead another turn or two.
Figure out what will happen if you and your opponent
both keep trying to build that same color.
In particular, figure out
<ul>
    <li> Who would run out of room first due to overpopulation?
    <li> Who would end up with the bigger ships?
</ul>
<p>
If your opponent will run out of room first and you end up with bigger ships,
then continuing to build that color is probably a good idea,
even if involves opening up a larger ship to them in the short term.
Don't be afraid to take a step down that path.
</p>
<p>
It's not only building that can open up choices for your opponent.
Here are other things to watch out for that may let your opponent get bigger ships than you.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> If your opponent has a medium or large green,
    they may be able to sacrifice it to
    <a href='../glossary.html#leapfrog'>skip past a size</a>.
    In that case, it's not good enough to make sure
    you aren't taking the <u>last</u> piece of its size.
    You need to be mindful of taking the second- or even third-to-last piece of its size.
    <li> If you discover a (small or medium) star that is the last piece of its size,
    you may be opening up the next size for your opponent to build.
    <li> When you abandon a system, the star marker goes to the bank.
    Your opponent may get to build the old "star" as a ship.
    <li> When you trade a ship for a different color,
    the old ship goes in the bank.
    Your opponent may get to build the old ship.
    <li> When you sacrifice a ship, it goes into the bank,
    and your opponent may get to build it.
    This is especially important in the late game when
    the bank is nearly empty and you want to sacrifice big ships for power plays.
    You may be handing your opponent the material they need to defend.
    <li> A catastrophe can put lots of pieces into the bank,
    especially if it destroyed a star.
    Your opponent may get the first chance to rebuild them.
    Few things are worse than to spend your ships
    to overpopulate your opponent's big ship--only
    to have them build it again on their next turn!
</ul>

<h2>
<a name='checklist'/>Turn checklist
</h2>
<p>
Between beginners,
almost all homeworlds games are lost because of a major blunder.
If you want to be really careful,
I suggest reading this whole checklist before you finalize your turn.
Every time.
The first time you don't check for all of these things may be the moment when you get surprised.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Identify <u>every</u> catastrophe your opponent could possibly cause.
    <ul>
        <li> Yellow sacrifices provide extreme mobility,
        which often catches people off-guard.
        Make sure you look at all the ways your opponent could sacrifice a yellow
        and move same-colored ships at your systems.
        <li> If they could cause a catastrophe where you lose more or bigger ships than them,
        then you probably need move ships out of the target system.
    </ul>
    <li> What if your opponent attempted an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li> If they were to start moving their ships
        into your home as quickly as possible, what would happen?
        <li> Could you attack the ships as quickly as they arrived?
        <li> Could there be a catastrophe that you wouldn't have time to prevent?
        <li> If their attack would just barely fail, what more do they need to make it succeed?
        <li> If your opponent is close to having a victory plan in place,
        figure out what you can do this turn to defend,
        such as getting a bigger red ship (to capture invaders faster)
        or moving a ship out of your home (if it is close to being overpopulated).
    </ul>
    <li> What if <u>you</u> were to attempt an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>What more do you need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
</ul>
