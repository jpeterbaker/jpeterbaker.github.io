<h2>
<a name='always_cat'>Always trigger catastrophes
</h2>
<p>
This large section deals with the very rare case that an overpopulation
is created by a player who doesn't want to trigger a catastrophe.
I'm talking about when the overpopulation is going to exist at the <u>end</u> of the player's turn,
not when a ship happens to briefly create an overpopulation as it passes through a system
while it moves twice with a yellow sacrifice move.
</p>
<p>
Overpopulations are almost always created intentionally
so that triggering the catastrophe will destroy the opponent's resources.
When I first teach people to play the game,
I usually don't bother to tell them that catastrophes are technically optional.
I sometimes use the words "overpopulation" and "catastrophe" interchangeably.
However, several people have asked me about whether it could ever be a good idea
to leave an overpopulation on the board at the end of their turn,
so I want to thoroughly explore the topic in this section.
</p>
<p>
For some idea of why it's not normal to create an overpopulation where you don't want the catastrophe,
take a look at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAIn7kDugGE&t=822s">this Homeworlds Theater episode</a>.
The overpopulating player didn't call catastrophe
and simply hoped that their opponent wouldn't either.
Fat chance.
If you don't want there to be a catastrophe,
you shouldn't set up an overpopulation.
That move was so poor that the next HW Theater episode was
all about replaying the game from that point with a different move.
</p>
<h3>
Yes, you should (almost) certainly call catastrophe
</h3>
<p>
I'm going to start by arguing that,
if your turn is going to <u>end</u> with an overpopulation on the board for any reason,
you should always trigger the catastrophe.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> If it's a catastrophe that helps you win (making it more likely that you will win),
    then obviously you should trigger it.
    This is usually what happens in games.
    <li> If it's a catastrophe that improves your opponent's chances of winning,
    then your opponent (<u>if</u> they also believe that the catastrophe helps them)
    will want trigger the catastrophe on their turn.
    What's more, if you let them trigger it, they might find a way to get some advantage out of
    triggering the catastrophe <u>after</u> they perform some other action
    (like building a large ship that will be unavailable after the catastrophe).
    So it is no worse and possibly better for you to trigger it yourself.
    <br>
    If you didn't want the catastrophe, you shouldn't have set up the overpopulation.
    But if you somehow get forced into an unwanted overpopulation,
    you should still trigger the catastrophe.
    <br>
    The topic of the entire next section is the phrase
    "If they also believe that the catastrophe helps them."
    <li> If it's a catastrophe that doesn't improve either player's chances of winning,
    then of course, it won't matter whether you trigger it.
    Just like with the "bad" catastrophe in the previous point,
    calling catastrophe won't hurt your chances.
</ul>
<p>
Human calculations on Homeworlds positions aren't perfect,
so you may not be sure whether a catastrophe is good, bad, or neutral.
But as I've just argued, you should trigger all kinds of catastrophes,
so it doesn't even matter if you are completely sure which kind it is.
Trigger it anyway.
</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>
Consider the extensive form game diagram above.
If Alice doesn't trigger the catastrophe, then Bob gets to choose between States A, B, and C.
Bob should choose whichever of these states is best for him (and therefore worst for Alice).
If Alice does trigger the catastrophe, then she is limiting Bob's options
because State A is guaranteed.
If State A is the worst of the three states for Alice,
Bob would choose it,
and the outcome is the same whether Alice triggers it or leaves it for Bob.
Therefore, Alice can't improve on the strategy
of always triggering catastrophes at the end of her turn.
</p>

<h3>
...unless you really want to trust in psychology
</h3>
<p>
So theoretically speaking, you should <u>never</u> leave an overpopulation on the board after your turn.
Strict game theoretical logic dictates that every overpopulation should become a catastrophe,
But there are several justifications for not triggering catastrophes
that are based on a belief in an opponent's imperfect mental state
(nobody thinks as perfectly as the game theory argument requires).
You may choose not to trigger a bad-for-you catastrophe as a gamble
that your opponent will also choose not to trigger it for some reason.
In that case, they will have gifted you another turn to try to resolve the overpopulation advantageously.
</p>

<center>
<h5>
Opponent has different beliefs
</h5>
</center>
<p>
Take a look at the diagram above.
Let's say that Alice thinks that State C is the best for her
(and therefore the worst for Bob)
but for some reason, Alice suspects that Bob believes that
State C is actually the <u>best</u> for Bob.
Alice would like the game to arrive in State C,
and she expects Bob to also prefer State C.
Alice rationally ignores the overpopulation and hopes that she is right that
Bob will choose to ignore it as well.
</p>
<p>
On Bob's turn, he believes (incorrectly, in Alice's opinion) that State C is best for him.
He doesn't want to trigger the catastrophe,
and if he is unable to remove the overpopulation some other way,
then Bob is in the position that Alice was just in;
he is wondering whether to trigger the bad catastrophe.
Having just turned down the opportunity to trigger the catastrophe,
Alice has given Bob a clue:
Bob should <u>know</u> that Alice believes the catastrophe is bad for her
<u>and</u> that she thinks that Bob thinks the catastrophe is bad for him
(since, as I've just argued, that's the only time Alice would choose not to trigger it).
So, if Bob hasn't changed his opinion that State C is better than the alternative (State B),
then he may decline to trigger the catastrophe using the same reasoning as Alice.
This could carry on until a player finds a way to
trade, move, or sacrifice one of the ships involved in the overpopulation.
</p>
<p>
Notice that Alice's decision to ignore the overpopulation doesn't actually rise from
the players' disagreement about which state benefits which player.
Alice's decision is based on Alice's <u>belief</u> that Bob's mental calculations are different from her own.
If Bob's calculations are different but Alice doesn't know it,
Alice should trigger the catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
Homeworlds is zero-sum game,
so Alice and Bob can't both be right:
if State C is better for Alice than A or B,
then State C is worse for Bob than A or B.
But there are various reasons why they might disagree.
Most likely it's because both players make mistakes.
No one can perfectly calculate how a catastrophe will affect the rest of the game
(unless it's very nearly over).
If Alice knows Bob well enough,
she may know what kinds of miscalculation he tends to make
and how that will affect his evaluation of a catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose that (in Alice's opinion),
Bob overestimates the strength of large ships.
Say that the overpopulation involves three of Alice's medium ships
and one of Bob's large ships.
Alice might think that her three mediums are worth more than Bob's large,
but Alice also knows that Bob thinks that their large is better than Alice's three mediums.
Alice is happy to not trigger the catastrophe,
and (assuming that Alice is correct about how Bob thinks)
Bob won't trigger it either.
</p>
<p>
Besides miscalculation, other things can cause players to have different beliefs.
For example, if you're playing with time control,
each player may think that they are more likely than their opponent to make mistakes under time pressure.
Prolonging the game will put both players under time pressure,
so each player thinks that they will be at a disadvantage in a long game.
If there's a catastrophe that is expected to prolong the game
(but that otherwise doesn't give an advantage to either player),
then each player will think that triggering the catastrophe is bad for them.
If you are aware of your opponent's belief that they
are more vulnerable to time pressure than you are
(the opposite of your belief),
then it is reasonable to not trigger the game-prolonging catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, energy for concentration is a limited resource that needs to be managed,
even in a game that isn't under formal time control.
If you believe that you are more tired than your opponent
but you believe that your opponent thinks that they are more tired than you are,
then you can reasonably not trigger a game-prolonging catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
The examples above take as a premise that
a catastrophe that destroys similar amounts of material for both players
tends to make the game last longer.
It's been my experience that catastrophes
(ones in <a href="glossary.html#colony">colonies</a> at any rate) are often followed
by several turns of rebuilding for both players,
which slows the game down.
This principle definitely doesn't apply to catastrophes that involve a homestar,
which tend to <a href="#swift_victory">accelerate the game dramatically</a>.
Maybe you believe that the catastrophe in your game will make the game end sooner
than if the catastrophe didn't happen.
In that case, just reverse the beliefs from the earlier arguments.
If each player believes themself to be <u>less</u> vulnerable to time pressure than their opponent
(and if they are aware of their opponent's opposing belief),
then they may reasonably choose not to trigger a game-shortening catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
To summarize this subsection,
it is reasonable for you to not trigger a catastrophe if
</p>
<ul>
    <li> You think that the catastrophe is "bad" for you
    <li> And you have reason to believe
    that your opponent erroneously thinks that the catastrophe is bad for them instead.
</ul>
<p>
A catastrophe is "bad" for a player if it decreases their chances of winning.
A player's belief about whether a catastrophe is bad depends on their position-evaluation heuristics
and on less-tangible factors such as
their ability to calculate under time pressure
(combined with how the catastrophe is expected to affect game length).
</p>

<center>
<h5>
Opponent has feelings
</h5>
</center>
<p>
It <u>feels</u> bad to lose important ships to a catastrophe
(unless it brings you closer to victory).
So if a catastrophe destroys ships for both players,
neither of you may <u>want</u> to trigger it
because of the bad feeling of losing ships.
So consider the case where there's an overpopulation
that would destroy lots of material for both you and your opponent.
Even if you think that the catastrophe is slightly better for your opponent's position,
you might reasonably not trigger it.
You should do this not for strictly logical reasons,
but in the hope that your opponent won't <u>feel</u> like losing that much material
for only a small advantage.
</p>

<center>
<h5>
Opponent's inexperience
</h5>
</center>
<p>
Finally, you might want to neglect triggering a catastrophe against a very inexperienced opponent.
New players might not notice the overpopulation;
they might not even know what a catastrophe is.
So you might be able to get away with an un-triggered catastrophe due to ignorance,
but, I absolutely do not condone exploiting players who don't know all of the rules.
You should make it a teaching moment by pointing out what they ought to do.
(And by the way, how did such an inexperienced player manage
to tangle you into an unwanted overpopulation anyway?)
</p>

<center>
<h5>
Opponent's clock can run instead of yours
</h5>
</center>
<p>
I can think of one reason to not trigger a catastrophe
that doesn't have to do with your opponent's head.
It has to do with time control instead.
</p>
<p>
Suppose that
</p>
<ul>
<li> You are playing with time control.
<li> There is an overpopulation on the board that is bad for you.
<li> You are sure that, if you leave the overpopulation on the board,
your opponent will <u>not</u> be able to get some extra advantage by triggering the catastrophe
at the end of their turn instead of the beginning.
<br>
In terms of the digram, you are Alice and State B is no worse for you than State A is.
</ul>
<p>
You might want to leave the overpopulation on the board
so that your opponent has to trigger the catastrophe themself,
which will cost them some time.
If you are playing with real life pieces,
carrying out the physical act of clearing the catastrophe pieces from the board
and sorting them back in the bank can easily take 10 seconds or more.
If you're playing on a digital system,
it will probably still take them some time
to tell the computer that they want to trigger the catastrophe.
All else being equal, it's better if that time comes off of your opponent's clock rather than yours.
(Just don't spend so long thinking about it that you wipe out the time savings).
</p>

<h3>
...unless there are three or more players
</h3>
<p>
This whole section on when to trigger catastrophes goes out the window
if you're not playing Binary Homeworlds.
When three or more players are involved, you can engage in diplomacy,
which is a totally different beast from what I'm analyzing on this page.
</p>
<p>
For an easy example of when not to trigger a catastrophe in a three-player game,
suppose that Alice is winning against Bob and Carol.
Bob and Carol have agreed to cooperate with each other for a while
until Alice is less of a threat.
Suppose Bob moves a large ship into one of Carol's systems in order to help defend against Alice,
but Bob's ship is the same color as three of Carol's ships.
Bob may choose not to trigger the catastrophe that would harm himself and his ally.
Instead, Bob can end his turn with the overpopulation on the board,
trusting that Carol will move, trade, or sacrifice a ship to remove the overpopulation.
Of course, Alice would trigger that catastrophe if the overpopulation
were still on the board when her turn came.
</p>

<h3>
... and unless the game is over
</h3>
<p>
Arthur O'Dwyer whipped up the example below.
</p>
<center>
<img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/camo/cc413ceb542c5ca15ee0ce9a96e51256d2fdce99/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f475a4e355663732e706e67">
</center>
<p>
It's Lee's turn.
The correct play is
</p>
<div class="moveTable">
    <div class="headerRow">
        <div class="headerCell">
            Lee
        </div>
        <div class="headerCell">
            Ray
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="moveRow">
        <div class="ply">
            1.
            <br>
            sacrifice b2 DS2
            <br>
            trade r3 y3 Lee
            <br>
            trade g3 r3 Ray
            <br>
            catastrophe Ray r
        </div>
        <div class="ply">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
Notice that Lee must refrain from triggering the yellow catastrophe in their own home
because this catastrophe would turn the win into a tie.
My original game-theory based argument does not apply to this situation because
Lee's opponent will not get a turn in which to trigger the catastrophe that Lee declined.
</p>

<h2>
<a name='etiquette'>Etiquette
</h2>
<p>
When playing Homeworlds online,
you might not interact with your opponent at all except through the game itself.
Computers take care of any timers and record-keeping.
But when playing with physical pieces at the same table,
there is more room for mistakes and irritation.
Be a good sport by having good manners.
</p>
<p>
Many generic rules of game etiquette are applicable to Homeworlds:
stay calm, don't show off, don't complain, etc.
In the English-speaking world,
chess seems to be the game with the best-established etiquette rules,
and that seems like a good place to start.
Homeworlds isn't (yet) played much in highly formal settings,
but besides my ideas below, you might get a feel for how to show respect to your opponent from
<a href='https://www.il-chess.org/sportsmanship-and-etiquette'>this
nice article on chess tournament etiquette</a>.
But unlike chess, some turns of Homeworlds have multiple complex steps,
so there is even more room for misunderstanding.
Here's my politeness advice that's specific to Homeworlds.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> The rules of Homeworlds always allow you to restart your turn,
    but if you move pieces around a bunch and restart your turns frequently,
    that's annoying.
    (Even in an online setting, repeated do-overs can be exasperating.)
    Restarting might lead to mistakes when putting the pieces back to their start positions.
    Try to visualize your plans before carrying them out on the board.
    Don't start moving pieces unless you truly intend to commit
    to the turn you are performing.
    <li> When you perform <a href='../glossary.html#star_towing'>
    star towing</a>, make sure your opponent understands what you're doing,
    and then move the pieces slowly and carefully, preferably one at a time.
    It's easy for little ships to land in the wrong systems
    if you shove piles of pieces across the play surface.
    <li> Don't make moves while your opponent is distracted,
    especially if you don't have a written game record or game clocks.
    <ul>
        <li> If you <u>do</u> have a written record,
        you can worry less about having their full attention.
        If they get confused, they can check later that your turn was legal,
        <li> If you <u>are</u> using clocks,
        any time your opponent wastes should come from their time bank,
        so you should feel free to take your turn and let their clock run.
    </ul>
    Ideally, even a casual game will have most of their attention,
    but if they need to step or look away briefly,
    don't execute a complex turn that could lead to them being confused about what took place
    (or thinking that you cheated).
    <li> I think its polite to narrate your turns slightly.
    You don't need to be verbose about it,
    but you can keep your opponent from misunderstanding or thinking you are cheating.
    For example, if you silently put a y3 ship in the bank,
    I don't even know at first whether you are trading or sacrificing.
    If you then start pulling new stars from the bank and shuffling ships around,
    I may get lost pretty quickly.
    A little narration helps the other player understand and verify your turn as it happens.
    <ul>
        <li> <u>But</u> if your opponent doesn't like narration,
        you should of course not do it.
        The whole point is to help them.
        <li> In a game without written records,
        you have the right to insist that your opponent explains what they have done
        or at least moves the pieces slowly enough that you can understand what's happening.
        <li> In a game with written records,
        
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name='nonbinary'>More than two players
</h2>
<p>
Andy Looney posted many thoughts about playing with more than two people
<a href='http://new.wunderland.com/2022/10/11/non-binary-homeworlds/'>
here</a>.
I have tried to include all of his ideas in this section.
</p>

<h3>
Super-Binary Homeworlds
</h3>

<p>
You can use the ordinary rules of Binary Homeworlds to play with more than two people.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Run a tournament</b>:
    Have each player play several games in some organized way
    to crown an overall group winner.
    <li> <b>Circular warfare</b>: sit in a circle and have everyone play two games,
    one with the player on each side.
    With three players, Andy calls this the Interstellar Threeway.
    <li> <b>Committees</b>:
    Split into two teams.
    Play Binary Homeworlds with each team acting as a player.
    (You may want to start by electing captains who gets the final word on each turn.)
    <li> <b>Double-cross style</b>:
    With four players, pair off into teams fo two.
    On each team, the two players are a captain and a first officer.
    The first officers make one suggestion every turn,
    and the captains take the turns for their team.
    However, after the second turn, captains are <i>required</i> to
    do something <i>other than</i> what their first officer suggested.
    Each first officer is actually trying to make their own captain lose
    by giving good suggestions that eliminate good options.
    <br>
    From my own experience with this format, I suggest a couple of things.
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Ships are unique</b>.
        If the first officer says, "We should move this y1 from system A to system B,"
        then the captain is allowed to move a <i>different</i> y1 from A to B.
        <li> <b>Bank pieces are not unique</b>.
        If the first officer says, "We should build this g1 in system A,"
        then their captain may <i>not</i> pick a "different" g1
        and build it in system A.
        <li> <b>Order of sacrifice actions doesn't matter</b>.
        When a first officer suggests a sacrifice turn with several actions,
        their captain can't take the suggestion while jsut changing the order of the actions.
        If it causes the same ships to end up in the same places,
        then it counts as the same turn.
        <li> A little more formally,
        I suggest starting by (at least mentally) giving each ship and system a label
        (but no labels for pieces that are in the bank at the start of the turn).
        A first officer's suggestion defines a board state (including the labels)
        that could be in place at the end of the turn.
        The captain is forbidden from ending their turn with that exact board state
        (even if they do it with actions in a different order from what the first officer stated).
        Any state that looks different from the forbidden state
        or that looks the same but differently labeled <i>is</i> allowed.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>
Non-binary Homeworlds
</h3>

<p>
You can instead play with more than two players or forces involved in the same game.
Some extra rule modifications are recommended in this case.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Elimination</b>:
        When a player loses control of their homeworld,
        they are eliminated from the game.
    <ul>
        <li> Eliminated players do not take turns anymore.
        <li> The derelict ships controlled by eliminated players stay on the board.
        They count as star occupants, preventing stars from being forgotten
        as long as they remain there.
        Derelict ships may be captured or involved in catastrophes.
        <li> Depending on the victory conditions you want to use,
        it may be important which player's action achieved the elimination.
    </ul>

    <li> <b>Number of pieces</b>:
        The community has widely accepted that the right number of pieces
        to put in the bank initially is N+1 of each color of trio,
        where N is the number of players.
    <li> <b>Setup equality</b>:
        Normally, players choose their homeworld setup one at a time in order.
        But this can create significant inequality if
        some players are much close to each other than to others,
        such as if a player decides to connect their homeworld to the home
        of a player who had to select their stars earlier.
        You may want to decide beforehand what sizes each player's stars should be
        in order to get a universe of balanced connections.
    <li> <b>Diplomacy</b>:
        Some players don't like to have their opponents
        giving each other advice on how to beat them,
        so take a moment before the game to agree on house rules for table talk.
        Are players allowed to whisper to each other,
        or does everyone have to hear every discussion?
        Can there be binding agreements,
        or should broken deals be a constant threat?
        Should you keep it simple by forbidding all conversation?
        <br>
        Also, it is easy to hurt other players in Homeworlds.
        You are likely to have chances to cripple another player and yourself
        to ensure that someone else wins.
        You may want to discuss how you feel about these "kingmaker" scenarios.
        Even if you don't decide to do anything about it,
        it may be nice to know that a player is likely to perform kamikaze attacks
        based on game earlier events
        (e.g., "You didn't let me build that b3, so now you're going to pay")
        or their relationship outside of the game.
        For example, my wife likes it when I lose, and she will go out of her way
        to give advantages to others over me.
        While I question whether that's a healthy feature of a theoretically loving relationship,
        it's better to know this beforehand than to be surprised mid-game and feel betrayed.
        <br>
        I wrote more about diplomacy in <a href='#diplomacy'>this section</a>.
</ul>

<h4>
Victory conditions
</h4>

<p>
There are more options for choosing the winner(s) when 3+ people play in a game.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <b>Last captain standing</b>:
    The last player who hasn't been eliminated is the winner.
    <li> <b>Sinister</b>:
    A player who causes the elimination of the player on their left is the winner.
    If a player eliminates a player who is not on their left,
    the game continues as though the eliminated player had never been there.
    <li> <b>Good vs evil</b>:
    Players are randomly and secretly assigned to be "good" or "evil"
    (half of players get each alignment, with one extra good player
    if the player count is odd).
    Every time a player is eliminated,
    the alignments of the eliminated player and the eliminator are revealed.
    A good player who eliminates another good player becomes an evil player.
    If all evil players are eliminated, the remaining good players share victory.
    An evil player becomes the sole winner by eliminating any other player.

    Interestingly, this is how John Cooper originally thought the game should be played.
    <li> <b>Teams</b>:
    <ol>
        <li> Decide whether eliminating a team requires
        eliminating just one player or the whole team.
        Andy suggests that eliminating a single member is sufficient.
        <li> Divide into cooperative teams of equal size.
        <li> Seat the players so that turn cycles evenly (e.g., A,B,C,A,B,C).
        <li> Decide on one of the above victory conditions using teams
        in place of individual players.
        <ul>
            <li> If there are just two teams,
            then you obviously just play until one team is eliminated.
            <li> For sinister teams, a team sits "left" of another team
            if its members are sitting directly to the left of that team's members.
        </ul>
        <li> Play your epic team match!
    </ol>

</ul>
<p>
    The rules of "sinister" and "good vs evil" emphasize the relationship
    between an eliminated player and their eliminator.
    It's a little unclear what to do if
    a poor-sport player wants to resign or self-eliminate
    just before someone else eliminates them.

<a name='diplomacy'>Diplomacy
</h3>
<p>
    I don't seem to excel at diplomacy in games.
    I blame it on being an annoying know-it-all that people like to see beaten ;-)
</p>
<p>
    One of the biggest differences between Binary and Non-Binary Homeworlds
    is that, with three or more players, it makes sense for them to negotiate.
    When two people (or teams) have perfectly opposite objectives,
    there can be no negotiation or collaboration between them because
    each player only succeeds to the extent that the other fails.
    Every outcome that one player wants the other player needs to avoid.
    There are no win-win moves.
    They are playing a "zero-sum" game.
</p>
<p>
    When three or more players each have their own objective,
    they can use diplomacy to advance their interests.
    If one player is winning, the other players may
    each improve their chances of winning by ganging up on the leader.
    Games for 3+ players
    are often won by a manipulator who can control the other players,
    even if the manipulator is less skilled at the underlying game.
</p>
<p>
    Something that many players (including me) love
    about zero-sum perfect-information games
    is that they win strictly by their wits without having to worry about charisma.
    Compared to games with diplomacy,
    zero-sum games feel pure and controlled.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, games with diplomacy are much more social.
    They're great for getting more people into a game together
    and getting to know each other.
    Other players' unpredictability creates a wild experience
    that's great for those who like to just enjoy the ride
    without fixating on whether the "right" person won.
