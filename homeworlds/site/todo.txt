Talk about colonies under strategy:
    In a large universe game, you generally only need one near colony but two far colonies (for stockpiling your Doomsday machine parts)
    What do you do if a colony is invaded?
    Capture the invaders if you can
    Consider catastrophe
    Consider counter attack
    Consider yellow sacrifice to get everyone out (sacrificing a yellow in that system reduces the number of refugees)

Talk about mirroring
    It's pretty common, especially if players have the same colors in their HWs.
    In fact, it's often the best choice for second player.

Puzzle
Something involving a blue sacrifice, since those are rare.
    How about, your opponent has just moved some ships into your home. You don't have a large red,
    but you could sacrifice a b2 to turn two of your home larges red. They could attack those, but then you can cat them,
    and they'd be spending their only red to do so leaving them helpless and you with the advantage.

Puzzle
A Doomsday machine where the phases are necessarily intermingled
    For example, you move in two larges of the star colors to start with
    you then cat whichever one they capture
    then you cat the other one
    The hard part will be making it so no other move order would work

Puzzle
A direct assault that fails because a monopoly is lost in the process.
    South has near-monopoly on red.
    North's only red is their large red at home.
    South wants to direct assault.
    It should be that North will clearly win unless South invades immediately
    North must defend by getting a medium ship (first move, the puzzle move).
    South moves two r3's to North's home
    North attacks an r3
    South sacrifices r2 elsewhere to attack two r3s
    Now that an r2 has been freed up, North trades the medium ship for red and destroys the invaders.
    It ought to be the case that South does not have any invasion opportunities immediately after.

More puzzles involving gaining a material advantage rather than just winning.
Also, more puzzles where the solution is not a sacrifice, catastrophe, or home invasion.

Puzzle
    You invade a colony where your large ship can be attacked, but only if your opponent sacrifices their only red ship (an r2). If they were to defend that way, you could launch a direct assault on their home, so they have to retreat or lose ships instead.
