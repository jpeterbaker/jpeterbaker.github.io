such as something involving a blue sacrifice, since those are rare.
    How about, your opponent has just moved some ships into your home. You don't have a large red,
    but you could sacrifice a b2 to turn two of your home larges red. They could attack those, but then you can cat them,
    and they'd be spending their only red to do so leaving them helpless and you with the advantage.

Your opponent has three small red ships (not at their home),
but no other access to red. You invade with two r3.
You trade an r3 three times until they are out of red power.

'Righteous' game mode should be the opposite of sinister: eliminate the player on your right
    This makes more sense to me for two reasons:
    1) "Sinister" comes from a word also meaning "left"
        The player who is "sinister" (on your left) should be the one trying to kill you
    2) This gives you the turn just before your would-be killer,
       and thus you have last-minute chance to defend yourself without other players having a chance to interfere before your killer moves.
