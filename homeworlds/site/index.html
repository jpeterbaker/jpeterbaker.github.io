<p>
This is a fan site for the board game
<a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds">
Homeworlds
</a>.
In particular, it's is about Binary Homeworlds,
so most pages assume that there are two players.

While I am serious about Homeworlds, I am not very serious about web design.
Sorry about the style.
