<h1>
Babamots' Homeworlds Site
</h1>
</center>
<p>
This is a fan site for the board game Homeworlds by John Cooper and published by Looney Labs.
</p>
<p>
In particular, this site is about <i>Binary</i> Homeworlds,
the two player version.
</p>
<p>
My site is intended for people with a basic understanding of Homeworlds.
If that's not you, you may want to look at the rules or tutorial videos listed on
<a href='https://www.looneylabs.com/content/homeworlds'>Looney Labs' Homeworlds index page</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href='strategy.html' style='font-size:32px'>My strategy guide</a>
is the best feature of this site. Enjoy :-)
</p>
<a href='https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=homeworlds'>My implementation on Board Game Arena</a>
is probably the best place to play online these days.
<ul>
    <li> Unfortunately, BGA doesn't let you rewind smoothly when reviewing games.
    The best place to review a game visually is the Homeworlds Live sandbox.
    <li> <a href='tools/process_record.html'>
    You can use this neat tool I made</a>
    to convert BGA's game log to HWL format.
</ul>

<span style='font-size:20px;color:red'>If you would like to support Homeworlds financially,</span>
the first thing you should do is buy a copy,
either as part of
<a href='https://store.looneylabs.com/products/pyramid-arcade'>
Pyramid Arcade
</a>
or the standalone
<a href='https://store.looneylabs.com/products/homeworlds'>
Pyramid Quartet box

I usually buy directly from Looney Labs,
but they would encourage you to buy from a local retail store.

<span style='font-size:20px;color:red'>If you would like to support <u>me</u>,</span>
who am I to say no?
I've put lots of work into organizing tournaments,
building this site, and writing the BGA implementation.
Over the years, a few people have asked how to show appreciation.
Now I finally have an answer:
you can send me donations through any of the fine services below.

While I am serious about Homeworlds, I am not very serious about web design.
Sorry about the style.
